    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the spring of 1878 there was living in Moscow, in a small wooden house
      in Shabolovka, a young man of five-and-twenty, called Yakov Aratov. With
      him lived his father&rsquo;s sister, an elderly maiden lady, over fifty,
      Platonida Ivanovna. She took charge of his house, and looked after his
      household expenditure, a task for which Aratov was utterly unfit. Other
      relations he had none. A few years previously, his father, a provincial
      gentleman of small property, had moved to Moscow together with him and
      Platonida Ivanovna, whom he always, however, called Platosha; her nephew,
      too, used the same name. On leaving the country-place where they had
      always lived up till then, the elder Aratov settled in the old capital,
      with the object of putting his son to the university, for which he had
      himself prepared him; he bought for a trifle a little house in one of the
      outlying streets, and established himself in it, with all his books and
      scientific odds and ends. And of books and odds and ends he had many&mdash;for
      he was a man of some considerable learning ... &lsquo;an out-and-out eccentric,&rsquo;
      as his neighbours said of him. He positively passed among them for a
      sorcerer; he had even been given the title of an &lsquo;insectivist.&rsquo; He studied
      chemistry, mineralogy, entomology, botany, and medicine; he doctored
      patients gratis with herbs and metallic powders of his own invention,
      after the method of Paracelsus. These same powders were the means of his
      bringing to the grave his pretty, young, too delicate wife, whom he
      passionately loved, and by whom he had an only son. With the same powders
      he fairly ruined his son&rsquo;s health too, in the hope and intention of
      strengthening it, as he detected anæmia and a tendency to consumption in
      his constitution inherited from his mother. The name of &lsquo;sorcerer&rsquo; had
      been given him partly because he regarded himself as a descendant&mdash;not
      in the direct line, of course&mdash;of the great Bruce, in honour of whom
      he had called his son Yakov, the Russian form of James.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was what is called a most good-natured man, but of melancholy
      temperament, pottering, and timid, with a bent for everything mysterious
      and occult.... A half-whispered ah! was his habitual exclamation; he even
      died with this exclamation on his lips, two years after his removal to
      Moscow.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son, Yakov, was in appearance unlike his father, who had been plain,
      clumsy, and awkward; he took more after his mother. He had the same
      delicate pretty features, the same soft ash-coloured hair, the same little
      aquiline nose, the same pouting childish lips, and great greenish-grey
      languishing eyes, with soft eyelashes. But in character he was like his
      father; and the face, so unlike the father&rsquo;s face, wore the father&rsquo;s
      expression; and he had the triangular-shaped hands and hollow chest of the
      old Aratov, who ought, however, hardly to be called old, since he never
      reached his fiftieth year. Before his death, Yakov had already entered the
      university in the faculty of physics and mathematics; he did not, however,
      complete his course; not through laziness, but because, according to his
      notions, you could learn no more in the university than you could studying
      alone at home; and he did not go in for a diploma because he had no idea
      of entering the government service. He was shy with his fellow-students,
      made friends with scarcely any one, especially held aloof from women, and
      lived in great solitude, buried in books. He held aloof from women, though
      he had a heart of the tenderest, and was fascinated by beauty.... He had
      even obtained a sumptuous English keepsake, and (oh shame!) gloated
      adoringly over its &lsquo;elegantly engraved&rsquo; representations of the various
      ravishing Gulnaras and Medoras.... But his innate modesty always kept him
      in check. In the house he used to work in what had been his father&rsquo;s
      study, it was also his bedroom, and his bed was the very one in which his
      father had breathed his last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mainstay of his whole existence, his unfailing friend and companion,
      was his aunt Platosha, with whom he exchanged barely a dozen words in the
      day, but without whom he could not stir hand or foot. She was a
      long-faced, long-toothed creature, with pale eyes, and a pale face, with
      an invariable expression, half of dejection, half of anxious dismay. For
      ever garbed in a grey dress and a grey shawl, she wandered about the house
      like a spirit, with noiseless steps, sighed, murmured prayers&mdash;especially
      one favourite one, consisting of three words only, &lsquo;Lord, succour us!&rsquo;&mdash;and
      looked after the house with much good sense, taking care of every
      halfpenny, and buying everything herself. Her nephew she adored; she was
      in a perpetual fidget over his health&mdash;afraid of everything&mdash;not
      for herself but for him; and directly she fancied the slightest thing
      wrong, she would steal in softly, and set a cup of herb tea on his
      writing-table, or stroke him on the spine with her hands, soft as wadding.
      Yakov was not annoyed by these attentions&mdash;though the herb tea he
      left untouched&mdash;he merely nodded his head approvingly. However, his
      health was really nothing to boast of. He was very impressionable,
      nervous, fanciful, suffered from palpitations of the heart, and sometimes
      from asthma; like his father, he believed that there are in nature and in
      the soul of man, mysteries which may sometimes be divined, but to which
      one can never penetrate; he believed in the existence of certain powers
      and influences, sometimes beneficent, but more often malignant,... and he
      believed too in science, in its dignity and importance. Of late he had
      taken a great fancy to photography. The smell of the chemicals used in
      this pursuit was a source of great uneasiness to his old aunt&mdash;not on
      her own account again, but on Yasha&rsquo;s, on account of his chest; but for
      all the softness of his temper, there was not a little obstinacy in his
      composition, and he persisted in his favourite pursuit. Platosha gave in,
      and only sighed more than ever, and murmured, &lsquo;Lord, succour us!&rsquo; whenever
      she saw his fingers stained with iodine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yakov, as we have already related, had held aloof from his
      fellow-students; with one of them he had, however, become fairly intimate,
      and saw him frequently, even after the fellow-student had left the
      university and entered the service, in a position involving little
      responsibility. He had, in his own words, got on to the building of the
      Church of our Saviour, though, of course, he knew nothing whatever of
      architecture. Strange to say, this one solitary friend of Aratov&rsquo;s, by
      name Kupfer, a German, so far Russianised that he did not know one word of
      German, and even fell foul of &lsquo;the Germans,&rsquo; this friend had apparently
      nothing in common with him. He was a black-haired, red-cheeked young man,
      very jovial, talkative, and devoted to the feminine society Aratov so
      assiduously avoided. It is true Kupfer both lunched and dined with him
      pretty often, and even, being a man of small means, used to borrow
      trifling sums of him; but this was not what induced the free and easy
      German to frequent the humble little house in Shabolovka so diligently.
      The spiritual purity, the idealism of Yakov pleased him, possibly as a
      contrast to what he was seeing and meeting every day; or possibly this
      very attachment to the youthful idealist betrayed him of German blood
      after all. Yakov liked Kupfer&rsquo;s simple-hearted frankness; and besides
      that, his accounts of the theatres, concerts, and balls, where he was
      always in attendance&mdash;of the unknown world altogether, into which
      Yakov could not make up his mind to enter&mdash;secretly interested and
      even excited the young hermit, without, however, arousing any desire to
      learn all this by his own experience. And Platosha made Kupfer welcome; it
      is true she thought him at times excessively unceremonious, but
      instinctively perceiving and realising that he was sincerely attached to
      her precious Yasha, she not only put up with the noisy guest, but felt
      kindly towards him.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the time with which our story is concerned, there was in Moscow a
      certain widow, a Georgian princess, a person of somewhat dubious, almost
      suspicious character. She was close upon forty; in her youth she had
      probably bloomed with that peculiar Oriental beauty, which fades so
      quickly; now she powdered, rouged, and dyed her hair yellow. Various
      reports, not altogether favourable, nor altogether definite, were in
      circulation about her; her husband no one had known, and she had never
      stayed long in any one town. She had no children, and no property, yet she
      kept open house, in debt or otherwise; she had a salon, as it is called,
      and received a rather mixed society, for the most part young men.
      Everything in her house from her own dress, furniture, and table, down to
      her carriage and her servants, bore the stamp of something shoddy,
      artificial, temporary,... but the princess herself, as well as her guests,
      apparently desired nothing better. The princess was reputed a devotee of
      music and literature, a patroness of artists and men of talent, and she
      really was interested in all these subjects, even to the point of
      enthusiasm, and an enthusiasm not altogether affected. There was an
      unmistakable fibre of artistic feeling in her. Moreover she was very
      approachable, genial, free from presumption or pretentiousness, and,
      though many people did not suspect it, she was fundamentally good-natured,
      soft-hearted, and kindly disposed.... Qualities rare&mdash;and the more
      precious for their rarity&mdash;precisely in persons of her sort! &lsquo;A fool
      of a woman!&rsquo; a wit said of her: &lsquo;but she&rsquo;ll get into heaven, not a doubt
      of it! Because she forgives everything, and everything will be forgiven
      her.&rsquo; It was said of her too that when she disappeared from a town, she
      always left as many creditors behind as persons she had befriended. A soft
      heart readily turned in any direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kupfer, as might have been anticipated, found his way into her house, and
      was soon on an intimate&mdash;evil tongues said a too intimate&mdash;footing
      with her. He himself always spoke of her not only affectionately but with
      respect; he called her a heart of gold&mdash;say what you like! and firmly
      believed both in her love for art and her comprehension of art! One day
      after dinner at the Aratovs&rsquo;, in discussing the princess and her evenings,
      he began to persuade Yakov to break for once from his anchorite seclusion,
      and to allow him, Kupfer, to present him to his friend. Yakov at first
      would not even hear of it. &lsquo;But what do you imagine?&rsquo; Kupfer cried at
      last: &lsquo;what sort of presentation are we talking about? Simply, I take you,
      just as you are sitting now, in your everyday coat, and go with you to her
      for an evening. No sort of etiquette is necessary there, my dear boy!
      You&rsquo;re learned, you know, and fond of literature and music&rsquo;&mdash;(there
      actually was in Aratov&rsquo;s study a piano on which he sometimes struck minor
      chords)&mdash;&lsquo;and in her house there&rsquo;s enough and to spare of all those
      goods!... and you&rsquo;ll meet there sympathetic people, no nonsense about
      them! And after all, you really can&rsquo;t at your age, with your looks (Aratov
      dropped his eyes and waved his hand deprecatingly), yes, yes, with your
      looks, you really can&rsquo;t keep aloof from society, from the world, like
      this! Why, I&rsquo;m not going to take you to see generals! Indeed, I know no
      generals myself!... Don&rsquo;t be obstinate, dear boy! Morality is an excellent
      thing, most laudable.... But why fall a prey to asceticism? You&rsquo;re not
      going in for becoming a monk!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov was, however, still refractory; but Kupfer found an unexpected ally
      in Platonida Ivanovna. Though she had no clear idea what was meant by the
      word asceticism, she too was of opinion that it would be no harm for dear
      Yasha to take a little recreation, to see people, and to show himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Especially,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;as I&rsquo;ve perfect confidence in Fyodor Fedoritch!
      He&rsquo;ll take you to no bad place!...&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bring him back in all his maiden
      innocence,&rsquo; shouted Kupfer, at which Platonida Ivanovna, in spite of her
      confidence, cast uneasy glances upon him. Aratov blushed up to his ears,
      but ceased to make objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ended by Kupfer taking him next day to spend an evening at the
      princess&rsquo;s. But Aratov did not remain there long. To begin with, he found
      there some twenty visitors, men and women, sympathetic people possibly,
      but still strangers, and this oppressed him, even though he had to do very
      little talking; and that, he feared above all things. Secondly, he did not
      like their hostess, though she received him very graciously and simply.
      Everything about her was distasteful to him: her painted face, and her
      frizzed curls, and her thickly-sugary voice, her shrill giggle, her way of
      rolling her eyes and looking up, her excessively low-necked dress, and
      those fat, glossy fingers with their multitude of rings!... Hiding himself
      away in a corner, he took from time to time a rapid survey of the faces of
      all the guests, without even distinguishing them, and then stared
      obstinately at his own feet. When at last a stray musician with a worn
      face, long hair, and an eyeglass stuck into his contorted eyebrow sat down
      to the grand piano and flinging his hands with a sweep on the keys and his
      foot on the pedal, began to attack a fantasia of Liszt on a Wagner motive,
      Aratov could not stand it, and stole off, bearing away in his heart a
      vague, painful impression; across which, however, flitted something
      incomprehensible to him, but grave and even disquieting.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      Kupfer came next day to dinner; he did not begin, however, expatiating on
      the preceding evening, he did not even reproach Aratov for his hasty
      retreat, and only regretted that he had not stayed to supper, when there
      had been champagne! (of the Novgorod brand, we may remark in parenthesis).
      Kupfer probably realised that it had been a mistake on his part to disturb
      his friend, and that Aratov really was a man &lsquo;not suited&rsquo; to that circle
      and way of life. On his side, too, Aratov said nothing of the princess,
      nor of the previous evening. Platonida Ivanovna did not know whether to
      rejoice at the failure of this first experiment or to regret it. She
      decided at last that Yasha&rsquo;s health might suffer from such outings, and
      was comforted. Kupfer went away directly after dinner, and did not show
      himself again for a whole week. And it was not that he resented the
      failure of his suggestion, the good fellow was incapable of that, but he
      had obviously found some interest which was absorbing all his time, all
      his thoughts; for later on, too, he rarely appeared at the Aratovs&rsquo;, had
      an absorbed look, spoke little and quickly vanished.... Aratov went on
      living as before; but a sort of&mdash;if one may so express it&mdash;little
      hook was pricking at his soul. He was continually haunted by some
      reminiscence, he could not quite tell what it was himself, and this
      reminiscence was connected with the evening he had spent at the
      princess&rsquo;s. For all that he had not the slightest inclination to return
      there again, and the world, a part of which he had looked upon at her
      house, repelled him more than ever. So passed six weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And behold one morning Kupfer stood before him once more, this time with a
      somewhat embarrassed countenance. &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; he began with a constrained
      smile, &lsquo;that your visit that time was not much to your taste; but I hope
      for all that you&rsquo;ll agree to my proposal ... that you won&rsquo;t refuse me my
      request!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; inquired Aratov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, do you see,&rsquo; pursued Kupfer, getting more and more heated: &lsquo;there
      is a society here of amateurs, artistic people, who from time to time get
      up readings, concerts, even theatrical performances for some charitable
      object.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the princess has a hand in it?&rsquo; interposed Aratov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The princess has a hand in all good deeds, but that&rsquo;s not the point. We
      have arranged a literary and musical matinée ... and at this matinée you
      may hear a girl ... an extraordinary girl! We cannot make out quite yet
      whether she is to be a Rachel or a Viardot ... for she sings exquisitely,
      and recites and plays.... A talent of the very first rank, my dear boy!
      I&rsquo;m not exaggerating. Well then, won&rsquo;t you take a ticket? Five roubles for
      a seat in the front row.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where has this marvellous girl sprung from?&rsquo; asked Aratov.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kupfer grinned. &lsquo;That I really can&rsquo;t say.... Of late she&rsquo;s found a home
      with the princess. The princess you know is a protector of every one of
      that sort.... But you saw her, most likely, that evening.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov gave a faint inward start ... but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has even played somewhere in the provinces,&rsquo; Kupfer continued, &lsquo;and
      altogether she&rsquo;s created for the theatre. There! you&rsquo;ll see for yourself!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rsquo; asked Aratov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clara...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clara?&rsquo; Aratov interrupted a second time. &lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why impossible? Clara ... Clara Militch; it&rsquo;s not her real name ... but
      that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s called. She&rsquo;s going to sing a song of Glinka&rsquo;s ... and
      of Tchaykovsky&rsquo;s; and then she&rsquo;ll recite the letter from <i>Yevgeny
      Oniegin</i>. Well; will you take a ticket?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when will it be?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow ... to-morrow, at half-past one, in a private drawing-room, in
      Ostozhonka.... I will come for you. A five-rouble ticket?... Here it is
      ... no, that&rsquo;s a three-rouble one. Here ... and here&rsquo;s the programme....
      I&rsquo;m one of the stewards.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov sank into thought. Platonida Ivanovna came in at that instant, and
      glancing at his face, was in a flutter of agitation at once. &lsquo;Yasha,&rsquo; she
      cried, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you? Why are you so upset? Fyodor
      Fedoritch, what is it you&rsquo;ve been telling him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov did not let his friend answer his aunt&rsquo;s question, but hurriedly
      snatching the ticket held out to him, told Platonida Ivanovna to give
      Kupfer five roubles at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      She blinked in amazement.... However, she handed Kupfer the money in
      silence. Her darling Yasha had ejaculated his commands in a very
      imperative manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you, a wonder of wonders!&rsquo; cried Kupfer, hurrying to the door.
      &lsquo;Wait till to-morrow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has she black eyes?&rsquo; Aratov called after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Black as coal!&rsquo; Kupfer shouted cheerily, as he vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov went away to his room, while Platonida Ivanovna stood rooted to the
      spot, repeating in a whisper, &lsquo;Lord, succour us! Succour us, Lord!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      The big drawing-room in the private house in Ostozhonka was already half
      full of visitors when Aratov and Kupfer arrived. Dramatic performances had
      sometimes been given in this drawing-room, but on this occasion there was
      no scenery nor curtain visible. The organisers of the matinée had confined
      themselves to fixing up a platform at one end, putting upon it a piano, a
      couple of reading-desks, a few chairs, a table with a bottle of water and
      a glass on it, and hanging red cloth over the door that led to the room
      allotted to the performers. In the first row was already sitting the
      princess in a bright green dress. Aratov placed himself at some distance
      from her, after exchanging the barest of greetings with her. The public
      was, as they say, of mixed materials; for the most part young men from
      educational institutions. Kupfer, as one of the stewards, with a white
      ribbon on the cuff of his coat, fussed and bustled about busily; the
      princess was obviously excited, looked about her, shot smiles in all
      directions, talked with those next her ... none but men were sitting near
      her. The first to appear on the platform was a flute-player of consumptive
      appearance, who most conscientiously dribbled away&mdash;what am I saying?&mdash;piped,
      I mean&mdash;a piece also of consumptive tendency; two persons shouted
      bravo! Then a stout gentleman in spectacles, of an exceedingly solid, even
      surly aspect, read in a bass voice a sketch of Shtchedrin; the sketch was
      applauded, not the reader; then the pianist, whom Aratov had seen before,
      came forward and strummed the same fantasia of Liszt; the pianist gained
      an encore. He bowed with one hand on the back of the chair, and after each
      bow he shook back his hair, precisely like Liszt! At last after a rather
      long interval the red cloth over the door on to the platform stirred and
      opened wide, and Clara Militch appeared. The room resounded with applause.
      With hesitating steps, she moved forward on the platform, stopped and
      stood motionless, clasping her large handsome ungloved hands in front of
      her, without a courtesy, a bend of the head, or a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a girl of nineteen, tall, rather broad-shouldered, but well-built.
      A dark face, of a half-Jewish half-gipsy type, small black eyes under
      thick brows almost meeting in the middle, a straight, slightly turned-up
      nose, delicate lips with a beautiful but decided curve, an immense mass of
      black hair, heavy even in appearance, a low brow still as marble, tiny
      ears ... the whole face dreamy, almost sullen. A nature passionate, wilful&mdash;hardly
      good-tempered, hardly very clever, but gifted&mdash;was expressed in every
      feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time she did not raise her eyes; but suddenly she started, and
      passed over the rows of spectators a glance intent, but not attentive,
      absorbed, it seemed, in herself.... &lsquo;What tragic eyes she has!&rsquo; observed a
      man sitting behind Aratov, a grey-headed dandy with the face of a Revel
      harlot, well known in Moscow as a prying gossip and writer for the papers.
      The dandy was an idiot, and meant to say something idiotic ... but he
      spoke the truth. Aratov, who from the very moment of Clara&rsquo;s entrance had
      never taken his eyes off her, only at that instant recollected that he
      really had seen her at the princess&rsquo;s; and not only that he had seen her,
      but that he had even noticed that she had several times, with a peculiar
      insistency, gazed at him with her dark intent eyes. And now too&mdash;or
      was it his fancy?&mdash;on seeing him in the front row she seemed
      delighted, seemed to flush, and again gazed intently at him. Then, without
      turning round, she stepped away a couple of paces in the direction of the
      piano, at which her accompanist, a long-haired foreigner, was sitting. She
      had to render Glinka&rsquo;s ballad: &lsquo;As soon as I knew you ...&rsquo; She began at
      once to sing, without changing the attitude of her hands or glancing at
      the music. Her voice was soft and resonant, a contralto; she uttered the
      words distinctly and with emphasis, and sang monotonously, with little
      light and shade, but with intense expression. &lsquo;The girl sings with
      conviction,&rsquo; said the same dandy sitting behind Aratov, and again he spoke
      the truth. Shouts of &lsquo;Bis!&rsquo; &lsquo;Bravo!&rsquo; resounded over the room; but she
      flung a rapid glance on Aratov, who neither shouted nor clapped&mdash;he
      did not particularly care for her singing&mdash;gave a slight bow, and
      walked out without taking the hooked arm proffered her by the long-haired
      pianist. She was called back ... not very soon, she reappeared, with the
      same hesitating steps approached the piano, and whispering a couple of
      words to the accompanist, who picked out and put before him another piece
      of music, began Tchaykovsky&rsquo;s song: &lsquo;No, only he who knows the thirst to
      see.&rsquo;... This song she sang differently from the first&mdash;in a low
      voice, as though she were tired ... and only at the line next the last,
      &lsquo;He knows what I have suffered,&rsquo; broke from her in a ringing, passionate
      cry. The last line, &lsquo;And how I suffer&rsquo; ... she almost whispered, with a
      mournful prolongation of the last word. This song produced less impression
      on the audience than the Glinka ballad; there was much applause,
      however.... Kupfer was particularly conspicuous; folding his hands in a
      peculiar way, in the shape of a barrel, at each clap he produced an
      extraordinarily resounding report. The princess handed him a large,
      straggling nosegay for him to take it to the singer; but she, seeming not
      to observe Kupfer&rsquo;s bowing figure, and outstretched hand with the nosegay,
      turned and went away, again without waiting for the pianist, who skipped
      forward to escort her more hurriedly than before, and when he found
      himself so unjustifiably deserted, tossed his hair as certainly Liszt
      himself had never tossed his!
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole time of the singing, Aratov had been watching Clara&rsquo;s
      face. It seemed to him that her eyes, through the drooping eyelashes, were
      again turned upon him; but he was especially struck by the immobility of
      the face, the forehead, the eyebrows; and only at her outburst of passion
      he caught through the hardly-parted lips the warm gleam of a close row of
      white teeth. Kupfer came up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear boy, what do you think of her?&rsquo; he asked, beaming all over
      with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a fine voice,&rsquo; replied Aratov; &lsquo;but she doesn&rsquo;t know how to sing
      yet; she&rsquo;s no real musical knowledge.&rsquo; (Why he said this, and what
      conception he had himself of &lsquo;musical knowledge,&rsquo; the Lord only knows!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Kupfer was surprised. &lsquo;No musical knowledge,&rsquo; he repeated slowly....
      &lsquo;Well, as to that ... she can acquire that. But what soul! Wait a bit,
      though; you shall hear her in Tatiana&rsquo;s letter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried away from Aratov, while the latter said to himself, &lsquo;Soul! with
      that immovable face!&rsquo; He thought that she moved and held herself like one
      hypnotised, like a somnambulist. And at the same time she was unmistakably
      ... yes! unmistakably looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the matinée went on. The fat man in spectacles appeared again;
      in spite of his serious exterior, he fancied himself a comic actor, and
      recited a scene from Gogol, this time without eliciting a single token of
      approbation. There was another glimpse of the flute-player; another
      thunder-clap from the pianist; a boy of twelve, frizzed and pomaded, but
      with tear-stains on his cheeks, thrummed some variations on a fiddle. What
      seemed strange was that in the intervals of the reading and music, from
      the performers&rsquo; room, sounds were heard from time to time of a French
      horn; and yet this instrument never was brought into requisition. In the
      sequel it appeared that the amateur, who had been invited to perform on
      it, had lost courage at the moment of facing the public. At last Clara
      Militch made her appearance again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held a volume of Pushkin in her hand; she did not, however, glance at
      it once during her recitation.... She was obviously nervous, the little
      book shook slightly in her fingers. Aratov observed also the expression of
      weariness which now overspread all her stern features. The first line, &lsquo;I
      write to you ... what more?&rsquo; she uttered exceedingly simply, almost
      naïvely, and with a naïve, genuine, helpless gesture held both hands out
      before her. Then she began to hurry a little; but from the beginning of
      the lines: &lsquo;Another! no! To no one in the whole world I have given my
      heart!&rsquo; she mastered her powers, gained fire; and when she came to the
      words, &lsquo;My whole life has but been a pledge of a meeting true with thee,&rsquo;
      her hitherto thick voice rang out boldly and enthusiastically, while her
      eyes just as boldly and directly fastened upon Aratov. She went on with
      the same fervour, and only towards the end her voice dropped again; and in
      it, and in her face, the same weariness was reflected again. The last four
      lines she completely &lsquo;murdered,&rsquo; as it is called; the volume of Pushkin
      suddenly slid out of her hand, and she hastily withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience fell to applauding desperately, encoring.... One
      Little-Russian divinity student bellowed in so deep a bass, &lsquo;Mill-itch!
      Mill-itch!&rsquo; that his neighbour civilly and sympathetically advised him,
      &lsquo;to take care of his voice, it would be the making of a protodeacon.&rsquo; But
      Aratov at once rose and made for the door. Kupfer overtook him.... &lsquo;I say,
      where are you off to?&rsquo; he called; &lsquo;would you like me to present you to
      Clara?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, thanks,&rsquo; Aratov returned hurriedly, and he went homewards
      almost at a run.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      He was agitated by strange sensations, incomprehensible to himself. In
      reality, Clara&rsquo;s recitation, too, had not been quite to his taste ...
      though he could not quite tell why. It disturbed him, this recitation; it
      struck him as crude and inharmonious.... It was as though it broke
      something within him, forced itself with a certain violence upon him. And
      those fixed, insistent, almost importunate looks&mdash;what were they for?
      what did they mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov&rsquo;s modesty did not for one instant admit of the idea that he might
      have made an impression on this strange girl, that he might have inspired
      in her a sentiment akin to love, to passion!... And indeed, he himself had
      formed a totally different conception of the still unknown woman, the girl
      to whom he was to give himself wholly, who would love him, be his bride,
      his wife.... He seldom dwelt on this dream&mdash;in spirit as in body he
      was virginal; but the pure image that arose at such times in his fancy was
      inspired by a very different figure, the figure of his dead mother, whom
      he scarcely remembered, but whose portrait he treasured as a sacred relic.
      The portrait was a water-colour, painted rather unskilfully by a lady who
      had been a neighbour of hers; but the likeness, as every one declared, was
      a striking one. Just such a tender profile, just such kind, clear eyes and
      silken hair, just such a smile and pure expression, was the woman, the
      girl, to have, for whom as yet he scarcely dared to hope....
    </p>
    <p>
      But this swarthy, dark-skinned creature, with coarse hair, dark eyebrows,
      and a tiny moustache on her upper lip, she was certainly a wicked, giddy
      ... &lsquo;gipsy&rsquo; (Aratov could not imagine a harsher appellation)&mdash;what
      was she to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet Aratov could not succeed in getting out of his head this
      dark-skinned gipsy, whose singing and reading and very appearance were
      displeasing to him. He was puzzled, he was angry with himself. Not long
      before he had read Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s novel, <i>St. Ronan&rsquo;s Well</i>
      (there was a complete edition of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s works in the library
      of his father, who had regarded the English novelist with esteem as a
      serious, almost a scientific, writer). The heroine of that novel is called
      Clara Mowbray. A poet who flourished somewhere about 1840, Krasov, wrote a
      poem on her, ending with the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Unhappy Clara! poor frantic Clara!
  Unhappy Clara Mowbray!&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      Aratov knew this poem also.... And now these words were incessantly
      haunting his memory.... &lsquo;Unhappy Clara! Poor, frantic Clara!&rsquo; ... (This
      was why he had been so surprised when Kupfer told him the name of Clara
      Militch.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Platosha herself noticed, not a change exactly in Yasha&rsquo;s temper&mdash;no
      change in reality took place in it&mdash;but something unsatisfactory in
      his looks and in his words. She cautiously questioned him about the
      literary matinée at which he had been present; muttered, sighed, looked at
      him from in front, from the side, from behind; and suddenly clapping her
      hands on her thighs, she exclaimed: &lsquo;To be sure, Yasha; I see what it is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why? what?&rsquo; Aratov queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve met for certain at that matinée one of those long-tailed
      creatures&rsquo;&mdash;this was how Platonida Ivanovna always spoke of all
      fashionably-dressed ladies of the period&mdash;&lsquo;with a pretty dolly face;
      and she goes prinking <i>this</i> way ... and pluming <i>that</i> way&rsquo;&mdash;Platonida
      presented these fancied manoeuvres in mimicry&mdash;&lsquo;and making saucers
      like this with her eyes&rsquo;&mdash;and she drew big, round circles in the air
      with her forefinger&mdash;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not used to that sort of thing. So you
      fancied ... but that means nothing, Yasha ... no-o-thing at all! Drink a
      cup of posset at night ... it&rsquo;ll pass off!... Lord, succour us!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Platosha ceased speaking, and left the room.... She had hardly ever
      uttered such a long and animated speech in her life.... While Aratov
      thought, &lsquo;Auntie&rsquo;s right, I dare say.... I&rsquo;m not used to it; that&rsquo;s all
      ...&rsquo;&mdash;it actually was the first time his attention had ever happened
      to be drawn to a person of the female sex ... at least he had never
      noticed it before&mdash;&lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t give way to it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he set to work on his books, and at night drank some lime-flower tea;
      and positively slept well that night, and had no dreams. The next morning
      he took up his photography again as though nothing had happened....
    </p>
    <p>
      But towards evening his spiritual repose was again disturbed.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI
    </h3>
    <p>
      And this is what happened. A messenger brought him a note, written in a
      large irregular woman&rsquo;s hand, and containing the following lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you guess who it is writes to you, and if it is not a bore to you,
      come to-morrow after dinner to the Tversky boulevard&mdash;about five
      o&rsquo;clock&mdash;and wait. You shall not be kept long. But it is very
      important. Do come.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no signature. Aratov at once guessed who was his correspondent,
      and this was just what disturbed him. &lsquo;What folly,&rsquo; he said, almost aloud;
      &lsquo;this is too much. Of course I shan&rsquo;t go.&rsquo; He sent, however, for the
      messenger, and from him learnt nothing but that the note had been handed
      him by a maid-servant in the street. Dismissing him, Aratov read the
      letter through and flung it on the ground.... But, after a little while,
      he picked it up and read it again: a second time he cried, &lsquo;Folly!&rsquo;&mdash;he
      did not, however, throw the note on the floor again, but put it in a
      drawer. Aratov took up his ordinary occupations, first one and then
      another; but nothing he did was successful or satisfactory. He suddenly
      realised that he was eagerly expecting Kupfer! Did he want to question
      him, or perhaps even to confide in him?... But Kupfer did not make his
      appearance. Then Aratov took down Pushkin, read Tatiana&rsquo;s letter, and
      convinced himself again that the &lsquo;gipsy girl&rsquo; had not in the least
      understood the real force of the letter. And that donkey Kupfer shouts:
      Rachel! Viardot! Then he went to his piano, as it seemed, unconsciously
      opened it, and tried to pick out by ear the melody of Tchaykovsky&rsquo;s song;
      but he slammed it to again directly in vexation, and went up to his aunt
      to her special room, which was for ever baking hot, smelled of mint, sage,
      and other medicinal herbs, and was littered up with such a multitude of
      rugs, side-tables, stools, cushions, and padded furniture of all sorts,
      that any one unused to it would have found it difficult to turn round and
      oppressive to breathe in it. Platonida Ivanovna was sitting at the window,
      her knitting in her hands (she was knitting her darling Yasha a comforter,
      the thirty-eighth she had made him in the course of his life!), and was
      much astonished to see him. Aratov rarely went up to her, and if he wanted
      anything, used always to call, in his delicate voice, from his study:
      &lsquo;Aunt Platosha!&rsquo; However, she made him sit down, and sat all alert, in
      expectation of his first words, watching him through her spectacles with
      one eye, over them with the other. She did not inquire after his health
      nor offer him tea, as she saw he had not come for that. Aratov was a
      little disconcerted ... then he began to talk ... talked of his mother, of
      how she had lived with his father and how his father had got to know her.
      All this he knew very well ... but it was just what he wanted to talk
      about. Unluckily for him, Platosha did not know how to keep up a
      conversation at all; she gave him very brief replies, as though she
      suspected that was not what Yasha had come for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh!&rsquo; she repeated, hurriedly, almost irritably plying her
      knitting-needles. &lsquo;We all know: your mother was a darling ... a darling
      that she was.... And your father loved her as a husband should, truly and
      faithfully even in her grave; and he never loved any other woman&rsquo;: she
      added, raising her voice and taking off her spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And was she of a retiring disposition?&rsquo; Aratov inquired, after a short
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Retiring! to be sure she was. As a woman should be. Bold ones have sprung
      up nowadays.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And were there no bold ones in your time?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There were in our time too ... to be sure there were! But who were they?
      A pack of strumpets, shameless hussies. Draggle-tails&mdash;for ever
      gadding about after no good.... What do they care? It&rsquo;s little they take
      to heart. If some poor fool comes in their way, they pounce on him. But
      sensible folk looked down on them. Did you ever see, pray, the like of
      such in our house?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov made no reply, and went back to his study. Platonida Ivanovna
      looked after him, shook her head, put on her spectacles again, and again
      took up her comforter ... but more than once sank into thought, and let
      her knitting-needles fall on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov up till very night kept telling himself, no! no! but with the same
      irritation, the same exasperation, he fell again into musing on the note,
      on the &lsquo;gipsy girl,&rsquo; on the appointed meeting, to which he would certainly
      not go! And at night she gave him no rest. He was continually haunted by
      her eyes&mdash;at one time half-closed, at another wide open&mdash;and
      their persistent gaze fixed straight upon him, and those motionless
      features with their dominating expression....
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he again, for some reason, kept expecting Kupfer; he was
      on the point of writing a note to him ... but did nothing, however,... and
      spent most of the time walking up and down his room. He never for one
      instant admitted to himself even the idea of going to this idiotic
      rendezvous ... and at half-past three, after a hastily swallowed dinner,
      suddenly throwing on his cloak and thrusting his cap on his head, he
      dashed out into the street, unseen by his aunt, and turned towards the
      Tversky boulevard.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Aratov found few people walking in it. The weather was damp and rather
      cold. He tried not to reflect on what he was doing, to force himself to
      turn his attention to every object that presented itself, and, as it were,
      persuaded himself that he had simply come out for a walk like the other
      people passing to and fro.... The letter of the day before was in his
      breast-pocket, and he was conscious all the while of its presence there.
      He walked twice up and down the boulevard, scrutinised sharply every
      feminine figure that came near him&mdash;and his heart throbbed.... He
      felt tired and sat down on a bench. And suddenly the thought struck him:
      &lsquo;What if that letter was not written by her, but to some one else by some
      other woman?&rsquo; In reality this should have been a matter of indifference to
      him ... and yet he had to admit to himself that he did not want this to be
      so. &lsquo;That would be too silly,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;even sillier than <i>this</i>!&rsquo;
      A nervous unrest began to gain possession of him; he began to shiver&mdash;not
      outwardly, but inwardly. He several times took his watch out of his
      waistcoat pocket, looked at the face, put it back, and each time forgot
      how many minutes it was to five. He fancied that every passer-by looked at
      him in a peculiar way, with a sort of sarcastic astonishment and
      curiosity. A wretched little dog ran up, sniffed at his legs, and began
      wagging its tail. He threatened it angrily. He was particularly annoyed by
      a factory lad in a greasy smock, who seated himself on a seat on the other
      side of the boulevard, and by turns whistling, scratching himself, and
      swinging his feet in enormous tattered boots, persistently stared at him.
      &lsquo;And his master,&rsquo; thought Aratov, &lsquo;is waiting for him, no doubt, while he,
      lazy scamp, is kicking up his heels here....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that very instant he felt that some one had come up and was
      standing close behind him ... there was a breath of something warm from
      behind....
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round.... She!
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew her at once, though a thick, dark blue veil hid her features. He
      instantaneously leapt up from the seat, but stopped short, and could not
      utter a word. She too was silent. He felt great embarrassment; but her
      embarrassment was no less. Aratov, even through the veil, could not help
      noticing how deadly pale she had turned. Yet she was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks,&rsquo; she began in an unsteady voice, &lsquo;thanks for coming. I did not
      expect ...&rsquo; She turned a little away and walked along the boulevard.
      Aratov walked after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have, perhaps, thought ill of me,&rsquo; she went on, without turning her
      head; &lsquo;indeed, my conduct is very strange.... But I had heard so much
      about you ... but no! I ... that was not the reason.... If only you
      knew.... There was so much I wanted to tell you, my God!... But how to do
      it ... how to do it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov was walking by her side, a little behind her; he could not see her
      face; he saw only her hat and part of her veil ... and her long black
      shabby cape. All his irritation, both with her and with himself, suddenly
      came back to him; all the absurdity, the awkwardness of this interview,
      these explanations between perfect strangers in a public promenade,
      suddenly struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come on your invitation,&rsquo; he began in his turn. &lsquo;I have come, my
      dear madam&rsquo; (her shoulders gave a faint twitch, she turned off into a side
      passage, he followed her), &lsquo;simply to clear up, to discover to what
      strange misunderstanding it is due that you are pleased to address me, a
      stranger to you ... who ... only <i>guessed</i>, to use your expression in
      your letter, that it was you writing to him ... guessed it because during
      that literary matinée, you saw fit to pay him such ... such obvious
      attention.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All this little speech was delivered by Aratov in that ringing but
      unsteady voice in which very young people answer at examinations on a
      subject in which they are well prepared.... He was angry; he was
      furious.... It was just this fury which loosened his ordinarily not very
      ready tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      She still went on along the walk with rather slower steps.... Aratov, as
      before, walked after her, and as before saw only the old cape and the hat,
      also not a very new one. His vanity suffered at the idea that she must now
      be thinking: &lsquo;I had only to make a sign&mdash;and he rushed at once!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov was silent ... he expected her to answer him; but she did not utter
      a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am ready to listen to you,&rsquo; he began again, &lsquo;and shall be very glad if
      I can be of use to you in any way ... though I am, I confess, surprised
      ... considering the retired life I lead....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these last words of his, Clara suddenly turned to him, and he beheld
      such a terrified, such a deeply-wounded face, with such large bright tears
      in the eyes, such a pained expression about the parted lips, and this face
      was so lovely, that he involuntarily faltered, and himself felt something
      akin to terror and pity and softening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, why ... why are you like that?&rsquo; she said, with an irresistibly
      genuine and truthful force, and how movingly her voice rang out! &lsquo;Could my
      turning to you be offensive to you?... is it possible you have understood
      nothing?... Ah, yes! you have understood nothing, you did not understand
      what I said to you, God knows what you have been imagining about me, you
      have not even dreamed what it cost me&mdash;to write to you!... You
      thought of nothing but yourself, your own dignity, your peace of mind!...
      But is it likely I&rsquo; ... (she squeezed her hands raised to her lips so
      hard, that the fingers gave a distinct crack).... &lsquo;As though I made any
      sort of demands of you, as though explanations were necessary first....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear madam,... I am, I confess, surprised,... if I can be of any use&rdquo;
       ... Ah! I am mad!&mdash;I was mistaken in you&mdash;in your face!... when
      I saw you the first time ...! Here ... you stand.... If only one word.
      What, not one word?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased.... Her face suddenly flushed, and as suddenly took a wrathful
      and insolent expression. &lsquo;Mercy! how idiotic this is!&rsquo; she cried suddenly,
      with a shrill laugh. &lsquo;How idiotic our meeting is! What a fool I am!... and
      you too.... Ugh!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a contemptuous wave of her hand, as though motioning him out of
      her road, and passing him, ran quickly out of the boulevard, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gesture of her hand, the insulting laugh, and the last exclamation, at
      once carried Aratov back to his first frame of mind, and stifled the
      feeling that had sprung up in his heart when she turned to him with tears
      in her eyes. He was angry again, and almost shouted after the retreating
      girl: &lsquo;You may make a good actress, but why did you think fit to play off
      this farce on me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned home with long strides, and though he still felt anger and
      indignation all the way, yet across these evil, malignant feelings,
      unconsciously, the memory forced itself of the exquisite face he had seen
      for a single moment only.... He even put himself the question, &lsquo;Why did I
      not answer her when she asked of me only a word? I had not time,&rsquo; he
      thought. &lsquo;She did not let me utter the word ... and what word could I have
      uttered?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he shook his head at once, and murmured reproachfully, &lsquo;Actress!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And again, at the same time, the vanity of the inexperienced nervous
      youth, at first wounded, was now, as it were, flattered at having any way
      inspired such a passion....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Though by now,&rsquo; he pursued his reflections, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all over, of course....
      I must have seemed absurd to her.&rsquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea was disagreeable to him, and again he was angry ... both with
      her ... and with himself. On reaching home, he shut himself up in his
      study. He did not want to see Platosha. The good old lady came twice to
      his locked door, put her ear to the keyhole, and only sighed and murmured
      her prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has begun!&rsquo; she thought.... &lsquo;And he only five-and-twenty! Ah, it&rsquo;s
      early, it&rsquo;s early!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      All the following day Aratov was in very low spirits. &lsquo;What is it, Yasha?&rsquo;
      Platonida Ivanovna said to him: &lsquo;you seem somehow all loose ends
      to-day!&rsquo;... In her own peculiar idiom the old lady&rsquo;s expression described
      fairly accurately Aratov&rsquo;s mental condition. He could not work and he did
      not know himself what he wanted. At one time he was eagerly on the watch
      for Kupfer, again he suspected that it was from Kupfer that Clara had got
      his address ... and from where else could she &lsquo;have heard so much about
      him&rsquo;? Then he wondered: was it possible his acquaintance with her was to
      end like this? Then he fancied she would write to him again; then he asked
      himself whether he ought not to write her a letter, explaining everything,
      since he did not at all like leaving an unfavourable impression of
      himself.... But exactly what to explain? Then he stirred up in himself
      almost a feeling of repulsion for her, for her insistence, her
      impertinence; and then again he saw that unutterably touching face and
      heard an irresistible voice; then he recalled her singing, her recitation&mdash;and
      could not be sure whether he had been right in his wholesale condemnation
      of it. In fact, he was all loose ends! At last he was heartily sick of it,
      and resolved to keep a firm hand over himself, as it is called, and to
      obliterate the whole incident, as it was unmistakably hindering his
      studies and destroying his peace of mind. It turned out not so easy to
      carry out this resolution ... more than a week passed by before he got
      back into his old accustomed groove. Luckily Kupfer did not turn up at
      all; he was in fact out of Moscow. Not long before the incident, Aratov
      had begun to work at painting in connection with his photographic plans;
      he set to work upon it now with redoubled zest.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, imperceptibly, with a few (to use the doctors&rsquo; expression) &lsquo;symptoms
      of relapse,&rsquo; manifested, for instance, in his once almost deciding to call
      upon the princess, two months passed ... then three months ... and Aratov
      was the old Aratov again. Only somewhere down below, under the surface of
      his life, something like a dark and burdensome secret dogged him wherever
      he went. So a great fish just caught on the hook, but not yet drawn up,
      will swim at the bottom of a deep stream under the very boat where the
      angler sits with a stout rod in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And one day, skimming through a not quite new number of the <i>Moscow
      Gazette</i>, Aratov lighted upon the following paragraph:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the greatest regret,&rsquo; wrote some local contributor from Kazan, &lsquo;we
      must add to our dramatic record the news of the sudden death of our gifted
      actress Clara Militch, who had succeeded during the brief period of her
      engagement in becoming a favourite of our discriminating public. Our
      regret is the more poignant from the fact that Miss Militch by her own act
      cut short her young life, so full of promise, by means of poison. And this
      dreadful deed was the more awful through the talented actress taking the
      fatal drug in the theatre itself. She had scarcely been taken home when to
      the universal grief, she expired. There is a rumour in the town that an
      unfortunate love affair drove her to this terrible act.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov slowly laid the paper on the table. In outward appearance he
      remained perfectly calm ... but at once something seemed to strike him a
      blow in the chest and the head&mdash;and slowly the shock passed on
      through all his limbs. He got up, stood still on the spot, and sat down
      again, again read through the paragraph. Then he got up again, lay down on
      the bed, and clasping his hands behind, stared a long while at the wall,
      as though dazed. By degrees the wall seemed to fade away ... vanished ...
      and he saw facing him the boulevard under the grey sky, and <i>her</i> in
      her black cape ... then her on the platform ... saw himself even close by
      her. That something which had given him such a violent blow in the chest
      at the first instant, began mounting now ... mounting into his throat....
      He tried to clear his throat; tried to call some one&mdash;but his voice
      failed him&mdash;and, to his own astonishment, tears rushed in torrents
      from his eyes ... what called forth these tears? Pity? Remorse? Or was it
      simply his nerves could not stand the sudden shock?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, she was nothing to him? was she?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, perhaps, it&rsquo;s not true after all,&rsquo; the thought came as a sudden
      relief to him. &lsquo;I must find out! But from whom? From the princess? No,
      from Kupfer ... from Kupfer? But they say he&rsquo;s not in Moscow&mdash;no
      matter, I must try him first!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these reflections in his head, Aratov dressed himself in haste,
      called a cab and drove to Kupfer&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IX
    </h3>
    <p>
      Though he had not expected to find him, he found him. Kupfer had, as a
      fact, been away from Moscow for some time, but he had now been back a
      week, and was indeed on the point of setting off to see Aratov. He met him
      with his usual heartiness, and was beginning to make some sort of
      explanation ... but Aratov at once cut him short with the impatient
      question, &lsquo;Have you heard it? Is it true?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is what true?&rsquo; replied Kupfer, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About Clara Militch?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kupfer&rsquo;s face expressed commiseration. &lsquo;Yes, yes, my dear boy, it&rsquo;s true;
      she poisoned herself! Such a sad thing!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov was silent for a while. &lsquo;But did you read it in the paper too?&rsquo; he
      asked&mdash;&lsquo;or perhaps you have been in Kazan yourself?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been in Kazan, yes; the princess and I accompanied her there. She
      came out on the stage there, and had a great success. But I didn&rsquo;t stay up
      to the time of the catastrophe ... I was in Yaroslav at the time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Yaroslav?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;I escorted the princess there.... She is living now at
      Yaroslav.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have trustworthy information?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trustworthy ... I have it at first-hand!&mdash;I made the acquaintance of
      her family in Kazan. But, my dear boy ... this news seems to be upsetting
      you? Why, I recollect you didn&rsquo;t care for Clara at one time? You were
      wrong, though! She was a marvellous girl&mdash;only what a temper! I was
      terribly broken-hearted about her!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov did not utter a word, he dropped into a chair, and after a brief
      pause, asked Kupfer to tell him ... he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; inquired Kupfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh ... everything,&rsquo; Aratov answered brokenly, &lsquo;all about her family ...
      and the rest of it. Everything you know!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, does it interest you? By all means!&rsquo; And Kupfer, whose face showed
      no traces of his having been so terribly broken-hearted about Clara, began
      his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his account Aratov learnt that Clara Militch&rsquo;s real name was Katerina
      Milovidov; that her father, now dead, had held the post of drawing-master
      in a school in Kazan, had painted bad portraits and holy pictures of the
      regulation type; that he had besides had the character of being a drunkard
      and a domestic tyrant; that he had left behind him, first a widow, of a
      shopkeeper&rsquo;s family, a quite stupid body, a character straight out of an
      Ostrovsky comedy; and secondly, a daughter much older than Clara and not
      like her&mdash;a very clever girl, and enthusiastic, only sickly, a
      remarkable girl&mdash;and very advanced in her ideas, my dear boy! That
      they were living, the widow and daughter, fairly comfortably, in a decent
      little house, obtained by the sale of the bad portraits and holy pictures;
      that Clara ... or Katia, if you like, from her childhood up impressed
      every one with her talent, but was of an insubordinate, capricious temper,
      and used to be for ever quarrelling with her father; that having an inborn
      passion for the theatre, at sixteen she had run away from her parent&rsquo;s
      house with an actress ...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With an actor?&rsquo; put in Aratov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not with an actor, with an actress, to whom she became attached....
      It&rsquo;s true this actress had a protector, a wealthy gentleman, no longer
      young, who did not marry her simply because he happened to be married&mdash;and
      indeed I fancy the actress was a married woman.&rsquo; Furthermore Kupfer
      informed Aratov that Clara had even before her coming to Moscow acted and
      sung in provincial theatres, that, having lost her friend the actress&mdash;the
      gentleman, too, it seemed, had died, or else he had made it up with his
      wife&mdash;Kupfer could not quite remember this&mdash;she had made the
      acquaintance of the princess, &lsquo;that heart of gold, whom you, my dear Yakov
      Andreitch,&rsquo; the speaker added with feeling, &lsquo;were incapable of
      appreciating properly&rsquo;; that at last Clara had been offered an engagement
      in Kazan, and that she had accepted it, though before then she used to
      declare that she would never leave Moscow! But then how the people of
      Kazan liked her&mdash;it was really astonishing! Whatever the performance
      was, nothing but nosegays and presents! nosegays and presents! A wholesale
      miller, the greatest swell in the province, had even presented her with a
      gold inkstand! Kupfer related all this with great animation, without
      giving expression, however, to any special sentimentality, and
      interspersing his narrative with the questions, &lsquo;What is it to you?&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;Why do you ask?&rsquo; when Aratov, who listened to him with devouring
      attention, kept asking for more and more details. All was told at last,
      and Kupfer was silent, rewarding himself for his exertions with a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why did she take poison?&rsquo; asked Aratov. &lsquo;In the paper it was
      stated....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kupfer waved his hand. &lsquo;Well ... that I can&rsquo;t say ... I don&rsquo;t know. But
      the paper tells a lie. Clara&rsquo;s conduct was exemplary ... no love affairs
      of any kind.... And indeed how should there be with her pride! She was
      proud&mdash;as Satan himself&mdash;and unapproachable! A headstrong
      creature! Hard as rock! You&rsquo;ll hardly believe it&mdash;though I knew her
      so well&mdash;I never saw a tear in her eyes!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I have,&rsquo; Aratov thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing,&rsquo; continued Kupfer, &lsquo;of late I noticed a great
      change in her: she grew so dull, so silent, for hours together there was
      no getting a word out of her. I asked her even, &ldquo;Has any one offended you,
      Katerina Semyonovna?&rdquo; For I knew her temper; she could never swallow an
      affront! But she was silent, and there was no doing anything with her!
      Even her triumphs on the stage didn&rsquo;t cheer her up; bouquets fairly
      showered on her ... but she didn&rsquo;t even smile! She gave one look at the
      gold inkstand&mdash;and put it aside! She used to complain that no one had
      written the real part for her, as she conceived it. And her singing she&rsquo;d
      given up altogether. It was my fault, my dear boy!... I told her that you
      thought she&rsquo;d no musical knowledge. But for all that ... why she poisoned
      herself&mdash;is incomprehensible! And the way she did it!...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In what part had she the greatest success?&rsquo;... Aratov wanted to know in
      what part she had appeared for the last time, but for some reason he asked
      a different question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Ostrovosky&rsquo;s <i>Gruna</i>, as far as I remember. But I tell you again
      she&rsquo;d no love affairs! You may be sure of that from one thing. She lived
      in her mother&rsquo;s house.... You know the sort of shopkeeper&rsquo;s houses: in
      every corner a holy picture and a little lamp before it, a deadly
      stuffiness, a sour smell, nothing but chairs along the walls in the
      drawing-room, a geranium in the window, and if a visitor drops in, the
      mistress sighs and groans, as if they were invaded by an enemy. What
      chance is there for gallantry or love-making? Sometimes they wouldn&rsquo;t even
      admit me. Their servant, a muscular female, in a red sarafan, with an
      enormous bust, would stand right across the passage, and growl, &ldquo;Where are
      you coming?&rdquo; No, I positively can&rsquo;t understand why she poisoned herself.
      Sick of life, I suppose,&rsquo; Kupfer concluded his cogitations
      philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov sat with downcast head. &lsquo;Can you give me the address of that house
      in Kazan?&rsquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; but what do you want it for? Do you want to write a letter there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, you know best. But the old lady won&rsquo;t answer, for she
      can&rsquo;t read and write. The sister, though, perhaps ... Oh, the sister&rsquo;s a
      clever creature! But I must say again, I wonder at you, my dear boy! Such
      indifference before ... and now such interest! All this, my boy, comes
      from too much solitude!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov made no reply, and went away, having provided himself with the
      Kazan address.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was on his way to Kupfer&rsquo;s, excitement, bewilderment, expectation
      had been reflected on his face.... Now he walked with an even gait, with
      downcast eyes, and hat pulled over his brows; almost every one who met him
      sent a glance of curiosity after him ... but he did not observe any one
      who passed ... it was not as on the Tversky boulevard!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unhappy Clara! poor frantic Clara!&rsquo; was echoing in his soul.
    </p>
    <h3>
      X
    </h3>
    <p>
      The following day Aratov spent, however, fairly quietly. He was even able
      to give his mind to his ordinary occupations. But there was one thing:
      both during his work and during his leisure he was continually thinking of
      Clara, of what Kupfer had told him the evening before. It is true that his
      meditations, too, were of a fairly tranquil character. He fancied that
      this strange girl interested him from the psychological point of view, as
      something of the nature of a riddle, the solution of which was worth
      racking his brains over. &lsquo;Ran away with an actress living as a kept
      mistress,&rsquo; he pondered, &lsquo;put herself under the protection of that
      princess, with whom she seems to have lived&mdash;and no <i>love affairs</i>&rsquo;?
      It&rsquo;s incredible!... Kupfer talked of pride! But in the first place we
      know&rsquo; (Aratov ought to have said: we have read in books),...&lsquo;we know that
      pride can exist side by side with levity of conduct; and secondly, how
      came she, if she were so proud, to make an appointment with a man who
      might treat her with contempt ... and did treat her with it ... and in a
      public place, moreover ... in a boulevard!&rsquo; At this point Aratov recalled
      all the scene in the boulevard, and he asked himself, Had he really shown
      contempt for Clara? &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he decided,... &lsquo;it was another feeling ... a
      feeling of doubt ... lack of confidence, in fact!&rsquo; &lsquo;Unhappy Clara!&rsquo; was
      again ringing in his head. &lsquo;Yes, unhappy,&rsquo; he decided again.... &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
      the most fitting word. And, if so, I was unjust. She said truly that I did
      not understand her. A pity! Such a remarkable creature, perhaps, came so
      close ... and I did not take advantage of it, I repulsed her.... Well, no
      matter! Life&rsquo;s all before me. There will be, very likely, other meetings,
      perhaps more interesting!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But on what grounds did she fix on <i>me</i> of all the world?&rsquo; He
      glanced into a looking-glass by which he was passing. &lsquo;What is there
      special about me? I&rsquo;m not a beauty, am I? My face ... is like any face....
      She was not a beauty either, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a beauty ... and such an expressive face! Immobile ... and yet
      expressive! I never met such a face.... And talent, too, she has ... that
      is, she had, unmistakable. Untrained, undeveloped, even coarse, perhaps
      ... but unmistakable talent. And in that case I was unjust to her.&rsquo; Aratov
      was carried back in thought to the literary musical matinée ... and he
      observed to himself how exceedingly clearly he recollected every word she
      had sung of recited, every intonation of her voice.... &lsquo;That would not
      have been so had she been without talent. And now it is all in the grave,
      to which she has hastened of herself.... But I&rsquo;ve nothing to do with that
      ... I&rsquo;m not to blame! It would be positively ridiculous to suppose that
      I&rsquo;m to blame.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It again occurred to Aratov that even if she had had &lsquo;anything of the
      sort&rsquo; in her mind, his behaviour during their interview must have
      effectually disillusioned her.... &lsquo;That was why she laughed so cruelly,
      too, at parting. Besides, what proof is there that she took poison because
      of unrequited love? That&rsquo;s only the newspaper correspondents, who ascribe
      every death of that sort to unrequited love! People of a character like
      Clara&rsquo;s readily feel life repulsive ... burdensome. Yes, burdensome.
      Kupfer was right; she was simply sick of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In spite of her successes, her triumphs?&rsquo; Aratov mused. He got a positive
      pleasure from the psychological analysis to which he was devoting himself.
      Remote till now from all contact with women, he did not even suspect all
      the significance for himself of this intense realisation of a woman&rsquo;s
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It follows,&rsquo; he pursued his meditations, &lsquo;that art did not satisfy her,
      did not fill the void in her life. Real artists exist only for art, for
      the theatre.... Everything else is pale beside what they regard as their
      vocation.... She was a dilettante.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Aratov fell to pondering again. &lsquo;No, the word dilettante did
      not accord with that face, the expression of that face, those eyes....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Clara&rsquo;s image floated again before him, with eyes, swimming in tears,
      fixed upon him, with clenched hands pressed to her lips....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, no, no,&rsquo; he muttered, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the use?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed the whole day. At dinner Aratov talked a great deal with
      Platosha, questioned her about the old days, which she remembered, but
      described very badly, as she had so few words at her command, and except
      her dear Yasha, had scarcely ever noticed anything in her life. She could
      only rejoice that he was nice and good-humoured to-day; towards evening
      Aratov was so far calm that he played several games of cards with his
      aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed the day ... but the night!
    </p>
    <h3>
      XI
    </h3>
    <p>
      It began well; he soon fell asleep, and when his aunt went into him on
      tip-toe to make the sign of the cross three times over him in his sleep&mdash;she
      did so every night&mdash;he lay breathing as quietly as a child. But
      before dawn he had a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dreamed he was on a bare steppe, strewn with big stones, under a
      lowering sky. Among the stones curved a little path; he walked along it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there rose up in front of him something of the nature of a thin
      cloud. He looked steadily at it; the cloud turned into a woman in a white
      gown with a bright sash round her waist. She was hurrying away from him.
      He saw neither her face nor her hair ... they were covered by a long veil.
      But he had an intense desire to overtake her, and to look into her face.
      Only, however much he hastened, she went more quickly than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the path lay a broad flat stone, like a tombstone. It blocked up the
      way. The woman stopped. Aratov ran up to her; but yet he could not see her
      eyes ... they were shut. Her face was white, white as snow; her hands hung
      lifeless. She was like a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, without bending a single limb, she fell backwards, and sank down
      upon the tombstone.... And then Aratov lay down beside her, stretched out
      straight like a figure on a monument, his hands folded like a dead man&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the woman suddenly rose, and went away. Aratov tried to get up too
      ... but he could neither stir nor unclasp his hands, and could only gaze
      after her in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the woman suddenly turned round, and he saw bright living eyes, in a
      living but unknown face. She laughed, she waved her hand to him ... and
      still he could not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed once more, and quickly retreated, merrily nodding her head, on
      which there was a crimson wreath of tiny roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov tried to cry out, tried to throw off this awful nightmare....
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly all was darkness around ... and the woman came back to him. But
      this was not the unknown statue ... it was Clara. She stood before him,
      crossed her arms, and sternly and intently looked at him. Her lips were
      tightly pressed together, but Aratov fancied he heard the words, &lsquo;If you
      want to know what I am, come over here!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here!&rsquo; he heard the wailing answer. &lsquo;Here!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up in bed, lighted the candle that stood on the little table by his
      bedside&mdash;but did not get up&mdash;and sat a long while, chill all
      over, slowly looking about him. It seemed to him as if something had
      happened to him since he went to bed; that something had taken possession
      of him ... something was in control of him. &lsquo;But is it possible?&rsquo; he
      murmured unconsciously. &lsquo;Does such a power really exist?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not stay in his bed. He quickly dressed, and till morning he was
      pacing up and down his room. And, strange to say, of Clara he never
      thought for a moment, and did not think of her, because he had decided to
      go next day to Kazan!
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought only of the journey, of how to manage it, and what to take with
      him, and how he would investigate and find out everything there, and would
      set his mind at rest. &lsquo;If I don&rsquo;t go,&rsquo; he reasoned with himself, &lsquo;why, I
      shall go out of my mind!&rsquo; He was afraid of that, afraid of his nerves. He
      was convinced that when once he had seen everything there with his own
      eyes, every obsession would vanish like that nightmare. &lsquo;And it will be a
      week lost over the journey,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;what is a week? else I shall
      never shake it off.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rising sun shone into his room; but the light of day did not drive
      away the shadows of the night that lay upon him, and did not change his
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Platosha almost had a fit when he informed her of his intention. She
      positively sat down on the ground ... her legs gave way beneath her. &lsquo;To
      Kazan? why to Kazan?&rsquo; she murmured, her dim eyes round with astonishment.
      She would not have been more surprised if she had been told that her Yasha
      was going to marry the baker woman next door, or was starting for America.
      &lsquo;Will you be long in Kazan?&rsquo; &lsquo;I shall be back in a week,&rsquo; answered Aratov,
      standing with his back half-turned to his aunt, who was still sitting on
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Platonida Ivanovna tried to protest more, but Aratov answered her in an
      utterly unexpected and unheard-of way: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a child,&rsquo; he shouted, and
      he turned pale all over, his lips trembled, and his eyes glittered
      wrathfully. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m twenty-six, I know what I&rsquo;m about, I&rsquo;m free to do what I
      like! I suffer no one ... Give me the money for the journey, pack my box
      with my clothes and linen ... and don&rsquo;t torture me! I&rsquo;ll be back in a
      week, Platosha,&rsquo; he added, in a somewhat softer tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Platosha got up, sighing and groaning, and, without further protest,
      crawled to her room. Yasha had alarmed her. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no head on my
      shoulders,&rsquo; she told the cook, who was helping her to pack Yasha&rsquo;s things;
      &lsquo;no head at all, but a hive full of bees all a-buzz and a-hum! He&rsquo;s going
      off to Kazan, my good soul, to Ka-a-zan!&rsquo; The cook, who had observed their
      dvornik the previous evening talking for a long time with a police
      officer, would have liked to inform her mistress of this circumstance, but
      did not dare, and only reflected, &lsquo;To Kazan! if only it&rsquo;s nowhere farther
      still!&rsquo; Platonida Ivanovna was so upset that she did not even utter her
      usual prayer. &lsquo;In such a calamity the Lord God Himself cannot aid us!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day Aratov set off for Kazan.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XII
    </h3>
    <p>
      He had no sooner reached that town and taken a room in a hotel than he
      rushed off to find out the house of the widow Milovidov. During the whole
      journey he had been in a sort of benumbed condition, which had not,
      however, prevented him from taking all the necessary steps, changing at
      Nizhni-Novgorod from the railway to the steamer, getting his meals at the
      stations etc., etc. He was convinced as before that <i>there</i>
      everything would be solved; and therefore he drove away every sort of
      memory and reflection, confining himself to one thing, the mental
      rehearsal of the <i>speech</i>, in which he would lay before the family of
      Clara Militch the real cause of his visit. And now at last he reached the
      goal of his efforts, and sent up his name. He was admitted ... with
      perplexity and alarm&mdash;still he was admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house of the widow Milovidov turned out to be exactly as Kupfer had
      described it; and the widow herself really was like one of the tradesmen&rsquo;s
      wives in Ostrovsky, though the widow of an official; her husband had held
      his post under government. Not without some difficulty, Aratov, after a
      preliminary apology for his boldness, for the strangeness of his visit,
      delivered the speech he had prepared, explaining that he was anxious to
      collect all the information possible about the gifted artist so early
      lost, that he was not led to this by idle curiosity, but by profound
      sympathy for her talent, of which he was the devoted admirer (he said
      that, devoted admirer!) that, in fact, it would be a sin to leave the
      public in ignorance of what it had lost&mdash;and why its hopes were not
      realised. Madame Milovidov did not interrupt Aratov; she did not
      understand very well what this unknown visitor was saying to her, and
      merely opened her eyes rather wide and rolled them upon him, thinking,
      however, that he had a quiet respectable air, was well dressed ... and not
      a pickpocket ... hadn&rsquo;t come to beg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are speaking of Katia?&rsquo; she inquired, directly Aratov was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes ... of your daughter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you have come from Moscow for this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, from Moscow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only on this account?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Milovidov gave herself a sudden shake. &lsquo;Why, are you an author? Do
      you write for the newspapers?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m not an author&mdash;and hitherto I have not written for the
      newspapers.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow bowed her head. She was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, I suppose ... it&rsquo;s from your own interest in the matter?&rsquo; she asked
      suddenly. Aratov could not find an answer for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Through sympathy, from respect for talent,&rsquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &lsquo;respect&rsquo; pleased Madame Milovidov. &lsquo;Eh!&rsquo; she pronounced with a
      sigh ... &lsquo;I&rsquo;m her mother, any way&mdash;and terribly I&rsquo;m grieved for
      her.... Such a calamity all of a sudden!... But I must say it: a crazy
      girl she always was&mdash;and what a way to meet with her end! Such a
      disgrace.... Only fancy what it was for a mother? we must be thankful
      indeed that they gave her a Christian burial....&rsquo; Madame Milovidov crossed
      herself. &lsquo;From a child up she minded no one&mdash;she left her parent&rsquo;s
      house ... and at last&mdash;sad to say!&mdash;turned actress! Every one
      knows I never shut my doors upon her; I loved her, to be sure! I was her
      mother, any way! she&rsquo;d no need to live with strangers ... or to go
      begging!...&rsquo; Here the widow shed tears ... &lsquo;But if you, my good sir,&rsquo; she
      began, again wiping her eyes with the ends of her kerchief, &lsquo;really have
      any idea of the kind, and you are not intending anything dishonourable to
      us, but on the contrary, wish to show us respect, you&rsquo;d better talk a bit
      with my other daughter. She&rsquo;ll tell you everything better than I can....
      Annotchka! called Madame Milovidov, &lsquo;Annotchka, come here! Here is a
      worthy gentleman from Moscow wants to have a talk about Katia!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of something moving in the next room; but no one
      appeared. &lsquo;Annotchka!&rsquo; the widow called again, &lsquo;Anna Semyonovna! come
      here, I tell you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door softly opened, and in the doorway appeared a girl no longer very
      young, looking ill&mdash;and plain&mdash;but with very soft and mournful
      eyes. Aratov got up from his seat to meet her, and introduced himself,
      mentioning his friend Kupfer. &lsquo;Ah! Fyodor Fedoritch?&rsquo; the girl articulated
      softly, and softly she sank into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, then, you must talk to the gentleman,&rsquo; said Madam Milovidov, getting
      up heavily: &lsquo;he&rsquo;s taken trouble enough, he&rsquo;s come all the way from Moscow
      on purpose&mdash;he wants to collect information about Katia. And will
      you, my good sir,&rsquo; she added, addressing Aratov&mdash;&lsquo;excuse me ... I&rsquo;m
      going to look after my housekeeping. You can get a very good account of
      everything from Annotchka; she will tell you about the theatre ... and all
      the rest of it. She is a clever girl, well educated: speaks French, and
      reads books, as well as her sister did. One may say indeed she gave her
      her education ... she was older&mdash;and so she looked after it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Milovidov withdrew. On being left alone with Anna Semyonovna,
      Aratov repeated his speech to her; but realising at the first glance that
      he had to do with a really cultivated girl, not a typical tradesman&rsquo;s
      daughter, he went a little more into particulars and made use of different
      expressions; but towards the end he grew agitated, flushed and felt that
      his heart was throbbing. Anna listened to him in silence, her hands folded
      on her lap; a mournful smile never left her face ... bitter grief, still
      fresh in its poignancy, was expressed in that smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You knew my sister?&rsquo; she asked Aratov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I did not actually know her,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;I met her and heard her
      once ... but one need only hear and see your sister once to ...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you wish to write her biography?&rsquo; Anna questioned him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov had not expected this inquiry; however, he replied promptly, &lsquo;Why
      not? But above all, I wanted to acquaint the public ...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna stopped him by a motion of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the object of that? The public caused her plenty of suffering as
      it is; and indeed Katia had only just begun life. But if you yourself&mdash;(Anna
      looked at him and smiled again a smile as mournful but more friendly ...
      as though she were saying to herself, Yes, you make me feel I can trust
      you) ... if you yourself feel such interest in her, let me ask you to come
      and see us this afternoon ... after dinner. I can&rsquo;t just now ... so
      suddenly ... I will collect my strength ... I will make an effort ... Ah,
      I loved her too much!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna turned away; she was on the point of bursting into sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov rose hurriedly from his seat, thanked her for her offer, said he
      should be sure ... oh, very sure!&mdash;to come&mdash;and went off,
      carrying away with him an impression of a soft voice, gentle and sorrowful
      eyes, and burning in the tortures of expectation.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Aratov went back the same day to the Milovidovs and spent three whole
      hours in conversation with Anna Semyonovna. Madame Milovidov was in the
      habit of lying down directly after dinner&mdash;at two o&rsquo;clock&mdash;and
      resting till evening tea at seven. Aratov&rsquo;s talk with Clara&rsquo;s sister was
      not exactly a conversation; she did almost all the talking, at first with
      hesitation, with embarrassment, then with a warmth that refused to be
      stifled. It was obvious that she had adored her sister. The confidence
      Aratov had inspired in her grew and strengthened; she was no longer stiff;
      twice she even dropped a few silent tears before him. He seemed to her to
      be worthy to hear an unreserved account of all she knew and felt ... in
      her own secluded life nothing of this sort had ever happened before!... As
      for him ... he drank in every word she uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was what he learned ... much of it of course, half-said ... much he
      filled in for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her early years, Clara had undoubtedly been a disagreeable child; and
      even as a girl, she had not been much gentler; self-willed, hot-tempered,
      sensitive, she had never got on with her father, whom she despised for his
      drunkenness and incapacity. He felt this and never forgave her for it. A
      gift for music showed itself early in her; her father gave it no
      encouragement, acknowledging no art but painting, in which he himself was
      so conspicuously unsuccessful though it was the means of support of
      himself and his family. Her mother Clara loved,... but in a careless way,
      as though she were her nurse; her sister she adored, though she fought
      with her and had even bitten her.... It is true she fell on her knees
      afterwards and kissed the place she had bitten. She was all fire, all
      passion, and all contradiction; revengeful and kind; magnanimous and
      vindictive; she believed in fate&mdash;and did not believe in God (these
      words Anna whispered with horror); she loved everything beautiful, but
      never troubled herself about her own looks, and dressed anyhow; she could
      not bear to have young men courting her, and yet in books she only read
      the pages which treated of love; she did not care to be liked, did not
      like caresses, but never forgot a caress, just as she never forgot a
      slight; she was afraid of death and killed herself! She used to say
      sometimes, &lsquo;Such a one as I want I shall never meet ... and no other will
      I have!&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, but if you meet him?&rsquo; Anna would ask. &lsquo;If I meet him ... I
      will capture him.&rsquo; &lsquo;And if he won&rsquo;t let himself be captured?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, then
      ... I will make an end of myself. It will prove I am no good.&rsquo; Clara&rsquo;s
      father&mdash;he used sometimes when drunk to ask his wife, &lsquo;Who got you
      your blackbrowed she-devil there? Not I!&rsquo;&mdash;Clara&rsquo;s father, anxious to
      get her off his hands as soon as possible, betrothed her to a rich young
      shopkeeper, a great blockhead, one of the so-called &lsquo;refined&rsquo; sort. A
      fortnight before the wedding-day&mdash;she was only sixteen at the time&mdash;she
      went up to her betrothed, her arms folded and her fingers drumming on her
      elbows&mdash;her favourite position&mdash;and suddenly gave him a slap on
      his rosy cheek with her large powerful hand! He jumped and merely gaped;
      it must be said he was head over ears in love with her.... He asked:
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rsquo; She laughed scornfully and walked off. &lsquo;I was there in
      the room,&rsquo; Anna related, &lsquo;I saw it all, I ran after her and said to her,
      &ldquo;Katia, why did you do that, really?&rdquo; And she answered me: &ldquo;If he&rsquo;d been a
      real man he would have punished me, but he&rsquo;s no more pluck than a drowned
      hen! And then he asks, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rsquo; If he loves me, and doesn&rsquo;t bear
      malice, he had better put up with it and not ask, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rsquo; I
      will never be anything to him&mdash;never, never!&rdquo; And indeed she did not
      marry him. It was soon after that she made the acquaintance of that
      actress, and left her home. Mother cried, but father only said, &ldquo;A
      stubborn beast is best away from the flock!&rdquo; And he did not bother about
      her, or try to find her out. My father did not understand Katia. On the
      day before her flight,&rsquo; added Anna, &lsquo;she almost smothered me in her
      embraces, and kept repeating: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t help it!... My heart&rsquo;s
      torn, but I can&rsquo;t help it! your cage is too small ... it cramps my wings!
      And there&rsquo;s no escaping one&rsquo;s fate....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After that,&rsquo; observed Anna, &lsquo;we saw each other very seldom.... When my
      father died, she came for a couple of days, would take nothing of her
      inheritance, and vanished again. She was unhappy with us ... I could see
      that. Afterwards she came to Kazan as an actress.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov began questioning Anna about the theatre, about the parts in which
      Clara had appeared, about her triumphs.... Anna answered in detail, but
      with the same mournful, though keen fervour. She even showed Aratov a
      photograph, in which Clara had been taken in the costume of one of her
      parts. In the photograph she was looking away, as though turning from the
      spectators; her thick hair tied with a ribbon fell in a coil on her bare
      arm. Aratov looked a long time at the photograph, thought it like, asked
      whether Clara had taken part in public recitations, and learnt that she
      had not; that she had needed the excitement of the theatre, the scenery
      ... but another question was burning on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anna Semyonovna!&rsquo; he cried at last, not loudly, but with a peculiar
      force, &lsquo;tell me, I implore you, tell me why did she ... what led her to
      this fearful step?&rsquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna looked down. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; she said, after a pause of some
      instants. &lsquo;By God, I don&rsquo;t know!&rsquo; she went on strenuously, supposing from
      Aratov&rsquo;s gesture that he did not believe her.... &lsquo;since she came back here
      certainly she was melancholy, depressed. Something must have happened to
      her in Moscow&mdash;what, I could never guess. But on the other hand, on
      that fatal day she seemed as it were ... if not more cheerful, at least
      more serene than usual. Even I had no presentiment,&rsquo; added Anna with a
      bitter smile, as though reproaching herself for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; she began again, &lsquo;it seemed as though at Katia&rsquo;s birth it had
      been decreed that she was to be unhappy. From her early years she was
      convinced of it. She would lean her head on her hand, sink into thought,
      and say, &ldquo;I shall not live long!&rdquo; She used to have presentiments. Imagine!
      she used to see beforehand, sometimes in a dream and sometimes awake, what
      was going to happen to her! &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t live as I want to live, then I
      won&rsquo;t live,&rdquo;... was a saying of hers too.... &ldquo;Our life&rsquo;s in our own hands,
      you know.&rdquo; And she proved that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna hid her face in her hands and stopped speaking. &lsquo;Anna Semyonovna,&rsquo;
      Aratov began after a short pause, &lsquo;you have perhaps heard to what the
      newspapers ascribed ... &ldquo;To an unhappy love affair?&rdquo;&rsquo; Anna broke in, at
      once pulling away her hands from her face. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a slander, a
      fabrication!... My pure, unapproachable Katia ... Katia!... and unhappy,
      unrequited love? And shouldn&rsquo;t I have known of it?... Every one was in
      love with her ... while she ... And whom could she have fallen in love
      with here? Who among all the people here, who was worthy of her? Who was
      up to the standard of honesty, truth, purity ... yes, above all, of purity
      which she, with all her faults, always held up as an ideal before her?...
      She repulsed!... she!...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna&rsquo;s voice broke.... Her fingers were trembling. All at once she flushed
      crimson ... crimson with indignation, and for that instant, and that
      instant only, she was like her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov was beginning an apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; Anna broke in again. &lsquo;I have an intense desire that you should
      not believe that slander, and should refute it, if possible! You want to
      write an article or something about her: that&rsquo;s your opportunity for
      defending her memory! That&rsquo;s why I talk so openly to you. Let me tell you;
      Katia left a diary ...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov trembled. &lsquo;A diary?&rsquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, a diary ... that is, only a few pages. Katia was not fond of writing
      ... for months at a time she would write nothing, and her letters were so
      short. But she was always, always truthful, she never told a lie.... She,
      with her pride, tell a lie! I ... I will show you this diary! You shall
      see for yourself whether there is the least hint in it of any unhappy love
      affair!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna quickly took out of a table-drawer a thin exercise-book, ten pages,
      no more, and held it out to Aratov. He seized it eagerly, recognised the
      irregular sprawling handwriting, the handwriting of that anonymous letter,
      opened it at random, and at once lighted upon the following lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Moscow, Tuesday ... June.&mdash;Sang and recited at a literary matinée.
      To-day is a vital day for me. <i>It must decide my fate.</i> (These words
      were twice underlined.) I saw again....&rsquo; Here followed a few lines
      carefully erased. And then, &lsquo;No! no! no!.... Must go back to the old way,
      if only ...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov dropped the hand that held the diary, and his head slowly sank upon
      his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Read it!&rsquo; cried Anna. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you read it? Read it through from the
      beginning.... It would take only five minutes to read it all, though the
      diary extends over two years. In Kazan she used to write down nothing at
      all....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov got up slowly from his chair and flung himself on his knees before
      Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was simply petrified with wonder and dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me ... give me that diary,&rsquo; Aratov began with failing voice, and he
      stretched out both hands to Anna. &lsquo;Give it me ... and the photograph ...
      you are sure to have some other one, and the diary I will return.... But I
      want it, oh, I want it!...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In his imploring words, in his contorted features there was something so
      despairing that it looked positively like rage, like agony.... And he was
      in agony, truly. He could not himself have foreseen that such pain could
      be felt by him, and in a frenzy he implored forgiveness, deliverance ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give it me,&rsquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But ... you ... you were in love with my sister?&rsquo; Anna said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov was still on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only saw her twice ... believe me!... and if I had not been impelled by
      causes, which I can neither explain nor fully understand myself,... if
      there had not been some power over me, stronger than myself.... I should
      not be entreating you ... I should not have come here. I want ... I must
      ... you yourself said I ought to defend her memory!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you were not in love with my sister?&rsquo; Anna asked a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov did not at once reply, and he turned aside a little, as though in
      pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then! I was! I was&mdash;I&rsquo;m in love now,&rsquo; he cried in the same
      tone of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steps were heard in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get up ... get up ...&rsquo; said Anna hurriedly. &lsquo;Mamma is coming.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And take the diary and the photograph, in God&rsquo;s name! Poor, poor
      Katia!... But you will give me back the diary,&rsquo; she added emphatically.
      &lsquo;And if you write anything, be sure to send it me.... Do you hear?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of Madame Milovidov saved Aratov from the necessity of a
      reply. He had time, however, to murmur, &lsquo;You are an angel! Thanks! I will
      send anything I write....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Milovidov, half awake, did not suspect anything. So Aratov left
      Kazan with the photograph in the breast-pocket of his coat. The diary he
      gave back to Anna; but, unobserved by her, he cut out the page on which
      were the words underlined.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way back to Moscow he relapsed again into a state of petrifaction.
      Though he was secretly delighted that he had attained the object of his
      journey, still all thoughts of Clara he deferred till he should be back at
      home. He thought much more about her sister Anna. &lsquo;There,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;is
      an exquisite, charming creature. What delicate comprehension of
      everything, what a loving heart, what a complete absence of egoism! And
      how girls like that spring up among us, in the provinces, and in such
      surroundings too! She is not strong, and not good-looking, and not young;
      but what a splendid helpmate she would be for a sensible, cultivated man!
      That&rsquo;s the girl I ought to have fallen in love with!&rsquo; Such were Aratov&rsquo;s
      reflections ... but on his arrival in Moscow things put on quite a
      different complexion.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIV
    </h3>
    <p>
      Platonida Ivanovna was unspeakably rejoiced at her nephew&rsquo;s return. There
      was no terrible chance she had not imagined during his absence. &lsquo;Siberia
      at least!&rsquo; she muttered, sitting rigidly still in her little room; &lsquo;at
      least for a year!&rsquo; The cook too had terrified her by the most
      well-authenticated stories of the disappearance of this and that young man
      of the neighbourhood. The perfect innocence and absence of revolutionary
      ideas in Yasha did not in the least reassure the old lady. &lsquo;For indeed ...
      if you come to that, he studies photography ... and that&rsquo;s quite enough
      for them to arrest him!&rsquo; &lsquo;And behold, here was her darling Yasha back
      again, safe and sound. She observed, indeed, that he seemed thinner, and
      looked hollow in the face; natural enough, with no one to look after him!
      but she did not venture to question him about his journey. She asked at
      dinner. &lsquo;And is Kazan a fine town?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered Aratov. &lsquo;I suppose
      they&rsquo;re all Tartars living there?&rsquo; &lsquo;Not only Tartars.&rsquo; &lsquo;And did you get a
      Kazan dressing-gown while you were there?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; With that the
      conversation ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as Aratov found himself alone in his own room, he quickly felt
      as though something were enfolding him about, as though he were once more
      <i>in the power</i>, yes, in the power of another life, another being.
      Though he had indeed said to Anna in that sudden delirious outburst that
      he was in love with Clara, that saying struck even him now as senseless
      and frantic. No, he was not in love; and how could he be in love with a
      dead woman, whom he had not even liked in her lifetime, whom he had almost
      forgotten? No, but he was in <i>her</i> power ... he no longer belonged to
      himself. He was <i>captured</i>. So completely captured, that he did not
      even attempt to free himself by laughing at his own absurdity, nor by
      trying to arouse if not a conviction, at least a hope in himself that it
      would all pass, that it was nothing but nerves, nor by seeking for proofs,
      nor by anything! &lsquo;If I meet him, I will capture him,&rsquo; he recalled those
      words of Clara&rsquo;s Anna had repeated to him. Well, he was captured. But was
      not she dead? Yes, her body was dead ... but her soul?... is not that
      immortal?... does it need corporeal organs to show its power? Magnetism
      has proved to us the influence of one living human soul over another
      living human soul.... Why should not this influence last after death, if
      the soul remains living? But to what end? What can come of it? But can we,
      as a rule, apprehend what is the object of all that takes place about us?
      These ideas so absorbed Aratov that he suddenly asked Platosha at tea-time
      whether she believed in the immortality of the soul. She did not for the
      first minute understand what his question was, then she crossed herself
      and answered. &lsquo;She should think so indeed! The soul not immortal!&rsquo; &lsquo;And,
      if so, can it have any influence after death?&rsquo; Aratov asked again. The old
      lady replied that it could ... pray for us, that is to say; at least, when
      it had passed through all its ordeals, awaiting the last dread judgment.
      But for the first forty days the soul simply hovered about the place where
      its death had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The first forty days?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; and then the ordeals follow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov was astounded at his aunt&rsquo;s knowledge, and went off to his room.
      And again he felt the same thing, the same power over him. This power
      showed itself in Clara&rsquo;s image being constantly before him to the minutest
      details, such details as he seemed hardly to have observed in her
      lifetime; he saw ... saw her fingers, her nails, the little hairs on her
      cheeks near her temples, the little mole under her left eye; he saw the
      slight movement of her lips, her nostrils, her eyebrows ... and her walk,
      and how she held her head a little on the right side ... he saw
      everything. He did not by any means take a delight in it all, only he
      could not help thinking of it and seeing it. The first night after his
      return he did not, however, dream of her ... he was very tired, and slept
      like a log. But directly he waked up, she came back into his room again,
      and seemed to establish herself in it, as though she were the mistress, as
      though by her voluntary death she had purchased the right to it, without
      asking him or needing his permission. He took up her photograph, he began
      reproducing it, enlarging it. Then he took it into his head to fit it to
      the stereoscope. He had a great deal of trouble to do it ... at last he
      succeeded. He fairly shuddered when through the glass he looked upon her
      figure, with the semblance of corporeal solidity given it by the
      stereoscope. But the figure was grey, as though covered with dust ... and
      moreover the eyes&mdash;the eyes looked always to one side, as though
      turning away. A long, long while he stared at them, as though expecting
      them to turn to him ... he even half-closed his eyelids on purpose ... but
      the eyes remained immovable, and the whole figure had the look of some
      sort of doll. He moved away, flung himself in an armchair, took out the
      leaf from her diary, with the words underlined, and thought, &lsquo;Well,
      lovers, they say, kiss the words traced by the hand of the beloved&mdash;but
      I feel no inclination to do that&mdash;and the handwriting I think ugly.
      But that line contains my sentence.&rsquo; Then he recalled the promise he had
      made Anna about the article. He sat down to the table, and set to work
      upon it, but everything he wrote struck him as so false, so rhetorical ...
      especially so false ... as though he did not believe in what he was
      writing nor in his own feelings.... And Clara herself seemed so utterly
      unknown and uncomprehended! She seemed to withhold herself from him. &lsquo;No!&rsquo;
      he thought, throwing down the pen ... &lsquo;either authorship&rsquo;s altogether not
      my line, or I must wait a little!&rsquo; He fell to recalling his visit to the
      Milovidovs, and all Anna had told him, that sweet, delightful Anna.... A
      word she had uttered&mdash;&lsquo;pure&rsquo;&mdash;suddenly struck him. It was as
      though something scorched him, and shed light. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said aloud, &lsquo;she
      was pure, and I am pure.... That&rsquo;s what gave her this power.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughts of the immortality of the soul, of the life beyond the grave
      crowded upon him again. Was it not said in the Bible: &lsquo;Death, where is thy
      sting?&rsquo; And in Schiller: &lsquo;And the dead shall live!&rsquo; (Auch die Todten
      sollen leben!)
    </p>
    <p>
      And too, he thought, in Mitskevitch: &lsquo;I will love thee to the end of time
      ... and beyond it!&rsquo; And an English writer had said: &lsquo;Love is stronger than
      death.&rsquo; The text from Scripture produced particular effect on Aratov....
      He tried to find the place where the words occurred.... He had no Bible;
      he went to ask Platosha for one. She wondered, she brought out, however, a
      very old book in a warped leather binding, with copper clasps, covered
      with candle wax, and handed it over to Aratov. He bore it off to his own
      room, but for a long time he could not find the text ... he stumbled,
      however, on another: &lsquo;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
      down his life for his friends&rsquo; (S. John xv. 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not right. It ought to be: Greater <i>power</i> hath
      no man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if she did not lay down her life for me at all? If she made an end of
      herself simply because life had become a burden to her? What if, after
      all, she did not come to that meeting for anything to do with love at
      all?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that instant he pictured to himself Clara before their parting on
      the boulevard.... He remembered the look of pain on her face, and the
      tears and the words, &lsquo;Ah, you understood nothing!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No! he could have no doubt why and for whom she had laid down her life....
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed that whole day till night-time.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XV
    </h3>
    <p>
      Aratov went to bed early, without feeling specially sleepy, but he hoped
      to find repose in bed. The strained condition of his nerves brought about
      an exhaustion far more unbearable than the bodily fatigue of the journey
      and the railway. However, exhausted as he was, he could not get to sleep.
      He tried to read ... but the lines danced before his eyes. He put out the
      candle, and darkness reigned in his room. But still he lay sleepless, with
      his eyes shut.... And it began to seem to him some one was whispering in
      his ear.... &lsquo;The beating of the heart, the pulse of the blood,&rsquo; he
      thought.... But the whisper passed into connected speech. Some one was
      talking in Russian hurriedly, plaintively, and indistinctly. Not one
      separate word could he catch.... But it was the voice of Clara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov opened his eyes, raised himself, leaned on his elbow.... The voice
      grew fainter, but kept up its plaintive, hurried talk, indistinct as
      before....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unmistakably Clara&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unseen fingers ran light arpeggios up and down the keys of the piano ...
      then the voice began again. More prolonged sounds were audible ... as it
      were moans ... always the same over and over again. Then apart from the
      rest the words began to stand out ... &lsquo;Roses ... roses ... roses....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Roses,&rsquo; repeated Aratov in a whisper. &lsquo;Ah, yes! it&rsquo;s the roses I saw on
      that woman&rsquo;s head in the dream.&rsquo;... &lsquo;Roses,&rsquo; he heard again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that you?&rsquo; Aratov asked in the same whisper. The voice suddenly
      ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov waited ... and waited, and dropped his head on the pillow.
      &lsquo;Hallucinations of hearing,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;But if ... if she really were
      here, close at hand?... If I were to see her, should I be frightened? or
      glad? But what should I be frightened of? or glad of? Why, of this, to be
      sure; it would be a proof that there is another world, that the soul is
      immortal. Though, indeed, even if I did see something, it too might be a
      hallucination of the sight....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted the candle, however, and in a rapid glance, not without a
      certain dread, scanned the whole room ... and saw nothing in it unusual.
      He got up, went to the stereoscope ... again the same grey doll, with its
      eyes averted. The feeling of dread gave way to one of annoyance. He was,
      as it were, cheated in his expectations ... the very expectation indeed
      struck him as absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, this is positively idiotic!&rsquo; he muttered, as he got back into bed,
      and blew out the candle. Profound darkness reigned once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov resolved to go to sleep this time.... But a fresh sensation started
      up in him. He fancied some one was standing in the middle of the room, not
      far from him, and scarcely perceptibly breathing. He turned round hastily
      and opened his eyes.... But what could be seen in impenetrable darkness?
      He began to feel for a match on his little bedside table ... and suddenly
      it seemed to him that a sort of soft, noiseless hurricane was passing over
      the whole room, over him, through him, and the word &lsquo;I!&rsquo; sounded
      distinctly in his ears....
    </p>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;I!... I!&rsquo;...
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some instants passed before he succeeded in getting the candle alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was no one in the room; and he now heard nothing, except the
      uneven throbbing of his own heart. He drank a glass of water, and stayed
      still, his head resting on his hand. He was waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought: &lsquo;I will wait. Either it&rsquo;s all nonsense ... or she is here. She
      is not going to play cat and mouse with me like this!&rsquo; He waited, waited
      long ... so long that the hand on which he was resting his head went numb
      ... but not one of his previous sensations was repeated. Twice his eyes
      closed.... He opened them promptly ... at least he believed that he opened
      them. Gradually they turned towards the door and rested on it. The candle
      burned dim, and it was once more dark in the room ... but the door made a
      long streak of white in the half darkness. And now this patch began to
      move, to grow less, to disappear ... and in its place, in the doorway
      appeared a woman&rsquo;s figure. Aratov looked intently at it ... Clara! And
      this time she was looking straight at him, coming towards him.... On her
      head was a wreath of red roses.... He was all in agitation, he sat up....
    </p>
    <p>
      Before him stood his aunt in a nightcap adorned with a broad red ribbon,
      and in a white dressing-jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Platosha!&rsquo; he said with an effort. &lsquo;Is that you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s I,&rsquo; answered Platonida Ivanovna ... &lsquo;I, Yasha darling, yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you come for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You waked me up. At first you kept moaning as it were ... and then you
      cried out all of a sudden, &ldquo;Save me! help me! &ldquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cried out?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and such a hoarse cry, &ldquo;Save me!&rdquo; I thought, Mercy on us! He&rsquo;s never
      ill, is he? And I came in. Are you quite well?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you must have had a bad dream then. Would you like me to burn a
      little incense?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov once more stared intently at his aunt, and laughed aloud.... The
      figure of the good old lady in her nightcap and dressing-jacket, with her
      long face and scared expression, was certainly very comic. All the mystery
      surrounding him, oppressing him&mdash;everything weird was sent flying
      instantaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Platosha dear, there&rsquo;s no need,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Please forgive me for
      unwittingly troubling you. Sleep well, and I will sleep too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Platonida Ivanovna remained a minute standing where she was, pointed to
      the candle, grumbled, &lsquo;Why not put it out ... an accident happens in a
      minute?&rsquo; and as she went out, could not refrain, though only at a
      distance, from making the sign of the cross over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov fell asleep quickly, and slept till morning. He even got up in a
      happy frame of mind ... though he felt sorry for something.... He felt
      light and free. &lsquo;What romantic fancies, if you come to think of it!&rsquo; he
      said to himself with a smile. He never once glanced either at the
      stereoscope, or at the page torn out of the diary. Immediately after
      breakfast, however, he set off to go to Kupfer&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      What drew him there ... he was dimly aware.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVI
    </h3>
    <p>
      Aratov found his sanguine friend at home. He chatted a little with him,
      reproached him for having quite forgotten his aunt and himself, listened
      to fresh praises of that heart of gold, the princess, who had just sent
      Kupfer from Yaroslav a smoking-cap embroidered with fish-scales ... and
      all at once, sitting just opposite Kupfer and looking him straight in the
      face, he announced that he had been a journey to Kazan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been to Kazan; what for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I wanted to collect some facts about that ... Clara Militch.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The one that poisoned herself?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kupfer shook his head. &lsquo;Well, you are a chap! And so quiet about it!
      Toiled a thousand miles out there and back ... for what? Eh? If there&rsquo;d
      been some woman in the case now! Then I can understand anything! anything!
      any madness!&rsquo; Kupfer ruffled up his hair. &lsquo;But simply to collect
      materials, as it&rsquo;s called among you learned people.... I&rsquo;d rather be
      excused! There are statistical writers to do that job! Well, and did you
      make friends with the old lady and the sister? Isn&rsquo;t she a delightful
      girl?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Delightful,&rsquo; answered Aratov, &lsquo;she gave me a great deal of interesting
      information.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did she tell you exactly how Clara took poison?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean ... how?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, in what manner?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No ... she was still in such grief ... I did not venture to question her
      too much. Was there anything remarkable about it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure there was. Only fancy; she had to appear on the stage that
      very day, and she acted her part. She took a glass of poison to the
      theatre with her, drank it before the first act, and went through all that
      act afterwards. With the poison inside her! Isn&rsquo;t that something like
      strength of will? Character, eh? And, they say, she never acted her part
      with such feeling, such passion! The public suspected nothing, they
      clapped, and called for her.... And directly the curtain fell, she dropped
      down there, on the stage. Convulsions ... and convulsions, and within an
      hour she was dead! But didn&rsquo;t I tell you all about it? And it was in the
      papers too!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov&rsquo;s hands had grown suddenly cold, and he felt an inward shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t tell me that,&rsquo; he said at last. &lsquo;And you don&rsquo;t know what
      play it was?
    </p>
    <p>
      Kupfer thought a minute. &lsquo;I did hear what the play was ... there is a
      betrayed girl in it.... Some drama, it must have been. Clara was created
      for dramatic parts.... Her very appearance ... But where are you off to?&rsquo;
      Kupfer interrupted himself, seeing that Aratov was reaching after his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel quite well,&rsquo; replied Aratov. &lsquo;Good-bye ... I&rsquo;ll come in
      another time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kupfer stopped him and looked into his face. &lsquo;What a nervous fellow you
      are, my boy! Just look at yourself.... You&rsquo;re as white as chalk.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not well,&rsquo; repeated Aratov, and, disengaging himself from Kupfer&rsquo;s
      detaining hands, he started homewards. Only at that instant it became
      clear to him that he had come to Kupfer with the sole object of talking of
      Clara...
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Unhappy Clara, poor frantic Clara....&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      On reaching home, however, he quickly regained his composure to a certain
      degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances accompanying Clara&rsquo;s death had at first given him a
      violent shock ... but later on this performance &lsquo;with the poison inside
      her,&rsquo; as Kupfer had expressed it, struck him as a kind of monstrous pose,
      a piece of bravado, and he was already trying not to think about it,
      fearing to arouse a feeling in himself, not unlike repugnance. And at
      dinner, as he sat facing Platosha, he suddenly recalled her midnight
      appearance, recalled that abbreviated dressing-jacket, the cap with the
      high ribbon&mdash;and why a ribbon on a nightcap?&mdash;all the ludicrous
      apparition which, like the scene-shifter&rsquo;s whistle in a transformation
      scene, had dissolved all his visions into dust! He even forced Platosha to
      repeat her description of how she had heard his scream, had been alarmed,
      had jumped up, could not for a minute find either his door or her own, and
      so on. In the evening he played a game of cards with her, and went off to
      his room rather depressed, but again fairly composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov did not think about the approaching night, and was not afraid of
      it: he was sure he would pass an excellent night. The thought of Clara had
      sprung up within him from time to time; but he remembered at once how
      &lsquo;affectedly&rsquo; she had killed herself, and turned away from it. This piece
      of &lsquo;bad taste&rsquo; blocked out all other memories of her. Glancing cursorily
      into the stereoscope, he even fancied that she was averting her eyes
      because she was ashamed. Opposite the stereoscope on the wall hung a
      portrait of his mother. Aratov took it from its nail, scrutinised it a
      long while, kissed it and carefully put it away in a drawer. Why did he do
      that? Whether it was that it was not fitting for this portrait to be so
      close to that woman ... or for some other reason Aratov did not inquire of
      himself. But his mother&rsquo;s portrait stirred up memories of his father ...
      of his father, whom he had seen dying in this very room, in this bed.
      &lsquo;What do you think of all this, father?&rsquo; he mentally addressed himself to
      him. &lsquo;You understand all this; you too believed in Schiller&rsquo;s world of
      spirits. Give me advice!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father would have advised me to give up all this idiocy,&rsquo; Aratov said
      aloud, and he took up a book. He could not, however, read for long, and
      feeling a sort of heaviness all over, he went to bed earlier than usual,
      in the full conviction that he would fall asleep at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it happened ... but his hopes of a quiet night were not realised.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVII
    </h3>
    <p>
      It had not struck midnight, when he had an extraordinary and terrifying
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dreamed that he was in a rich manor-house of which he was the owner. He
      had lately bought both the house and the estate attached to it. And he
      kept thinking, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nice, very nice now, but evil is coming!&rsquo; Beside him
      moved to and fro a little tiny man, his steward; he kept laughing, bowing,
      and trying to show Aratov how admirably everything was arranged in his
      house and his estate. &lsquo;This way, pray, this way, pray,&rsquo; he kept repeating,
      chuckling at every word; &lsquo;kindly look how prosperous everything is with
      you! Look at the horses ... what splendid horses!&rsquo; And Aratov saw a row of
      immense horses. They were standing in their stalls with their backs to
      him; their manes and tails were magnificent ... but as soon as Aratov went
      near, the horses&rsquo; heads turned towards him, and they showed their teeth
      viciously. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very nice,&rsquo; Aratov thought! &lsquo;but evil is coming!&rsquo; &lsquo;This
      way, pray, this way,&rsquo; the steward repeated again, &lsquo;pray come into the
      garden: look what fine apples you have!&rsquo; The apples certainly were fine,
      red, and round; but as soon as Aratov looked at them, they withered and
      fell ... &lsquo;Evil is coming,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;And here is the lake,&rsquo; lisped the
      steward, &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t it blue and smooth? And here&rsquo;s a little boat of gold ...
      will you get into it?... it floats of itself.&rsquo; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t get into it,&rsquo;
      thought Aratov, &lsquo;evil is coming!&rsquo; and for all that he got into the boat.
      At the bottom lay huddled up a little creature like a monkey; it was
      holding in its paws a glass full of a dark liquid. &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t be uneasy,&rsquo;
      the steward shouted from the bank ... &lsquo;It&rsquo;s of no consequence! It&rsquo;s death!
      Good luck to you!&rsquo; The boat darted swiftly along ... but all of a sudden a
      hurricane came swooping down on it, not like the hurricane of the night
      before, soft and noiseless&mdash;no; a black, awful, howling hurricane!
      Everything was confusion. And in the midst of the whirling darkness Aratov
      saw Clara in a stage-dress; she was lifting a glass to her lips, listening
      to shouts of &lsquo;Bravo! bravo!&rsquo; in the distance, and some coarse voice
      shouted in Aratov&rsquo;s ear: &lsquo;Ah! did you think it would all end in a farce?
      No; it&rsquo;s a tragedy! a tragedy!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling all over, Aratov awoke. In the room it was not dark.... A faint
      light streamed in from somewhere, and showed every thing in the gloom and
      stillness. Aratov did not ask himself whence this light came.... He felt
      one thing only: Clara was there, in that room ... he felt her presence ...
      he was again and for ever in her power!
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry broke from his lips, &lsquo;Clara, are you here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; sounded distinctly in the midst of the lighted, still room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov inaudibly repeated his question....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; he heard again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I want to see you!&rsquo; he cried, and he jumped out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some instants he stood in the same place, pressing his bare feet on
      the chill floor. His eyes strayed about. &lsquo;Where? where?&rsquo; his lips were
      murmuring....
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing to be seen, not a sound to be heard.... He looked round him, and
      noticed that the faint light that filled the room came from a night-light,
      shaded by a sheet of paper and set in a corner, probably by Platosha while
      he was asleep. He even discerned the smell of incense ... also, most
      likely, the work of her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurriedly dressed himself: to remain in bed, to sleep, was not to be
      thought of. Then he took his stand in the middle of the room, and folded
      his arms. The sense of Clara&rsquo;s presence was stronger in him than it had
      ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he began to speak, not loudly, but with solemn deliberation, as
      though he were uttering an incantation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clara,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;if you are truly here, if you see me, if you hear me&mdash;show
      yourself!... If the power which I feel over me is truly your power, show
      yourself! If you understand how bitterly I repent that I did not
      understand you, that I repelled you&mdash;show yourself! If what I have
      heard was truly your voice; if the feeling overmastering me is love; if
      you are now convinced that I love you, I, who till now have neither loved
      nor known any woman; if you know that since your death I have come to love
      you passionately, inconsolably; if you do not want me to go mad,&mdash;show
      yourself, Clara!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov had hardly uttered this last word, when all at once he felt that
      some one was swiftly approaching him from behind&mdash;as that day on the
      boulevard&mdash;and laying a hand on his shoulder. He turned round, and
      saw no one. But the sense of <i>her</i> presence had grown so distinct, so
      unmistakable, that once more he looked hurriedly about him....
    </p>
    <p>
      What was that? On an easy-chair, two paces from him, sat a woman, all in
      black. Her head was turned away, as in the stereoscope.... It was she! It
      was Clara! But what a stern, sad face!
    </p>
    <p>
      Aratov slowly sank on his knees. Yes; he was right, then. He felt neither
      fear nor delight, not even astonishment.... His heart even began to beat
      more quietly. He had one sense, one feeling, &lsquo;Ah! at last! at last!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clara,&rsquo; he began, in a faint but steady voice, &lsquo;why do you not look at
      me? I know that it is you ... but I may fancy my imagination has created
      an image like <i>that one</i> ... &lsquo;&mdash;he pointed towards the
      stereoscope&mdash;&lsquo;prove to me that it is you.... Turn to me, look at me,
      Clara!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara&rsquo;s hand slowly rose ... and fell again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clara! Clara! turn to me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Clara&rsquo;s head slowly turned, her closed lids opened, and her dark eyes
      fastened upon Aratov.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell back a little, and uttered a single, long-drawn-out, trembling
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara gazed fixedly at him ... but her eyes, her features, retained their
      former mournfully stern, almost displeased expression. With just that
      expression on her face she had come on to the platform on the day of the
      literary matinée, before she caught sight of Aratov. And, just as then,
      she suddenly flushed, her face brightened, her eyes kindled, and a joyful,
      triumphant smile parted her lips....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come!&rsquo; cried Aratov. &lsquo;You have conquered.... Take me! I am yours,
      and you are mine!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He flew to her; he tried to kiss those smiling, triumphant lips, and he
      kissed them. He felt their burning touch: he even felt the moist chill of
      her teeth: and a cry of triumph rang through the half-dark room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Platonida Ivanovna, running in, found him in a swoon. He was on his knees;
      his head was lying on the arm-chair; his outstretched arms hung powerless;
      his pale face was radiant with the intoxication of boundless bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Platonida Ivanovna fairly dropped to the ground beside him; she put her
      arms round him, faltered, &lsquo;Yasha! Yasha, darling! Yasha, dearest!&rsquo; tried
      to lift him in her bony arms ... he did not stir. Then Platonida Ivanovna
      fell to screaming in a voice unlike her own. The servant ran in. Together
      they somehow roused him, began throwing water over him&mdash;even took it
      from the holy lamp before the holy picture....
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to himself. But in response to his aunt&rsquo;s questions he only
      smiled, and with such an ecstatic face that she was more alarmed than
      ever, and kept crossing first herself and then him.... Aratov, at last,
      put aside her hand, and, still with the same ecstatic expression of face,
      said: &lsquo;Why, Platosha, what is the matter with you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter with you, Yasha darling?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With me? I am happy ... happy, Platosha ... that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with
      me. And now I want to lie down, to sleep....&rsquo; He tried to get up, but felt
      such a sense of weakness in his legs, and in his whole body, that he could
      not, without the help of his aunt and the servant, undress and get into
      bed. But he fell asleep very quickly, still with the same look of blissful
      triumph on his face. Only his face was very pale.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Platonida Ivanovna came in to him next morning, he was still in the
      same position ... but the weakness had not passed off, and he actually
      preferred to remain in bed. Platonida Ivanovna did not like the pallor of
      his face at all. &lsquo;Lord, have mercy on us! what is it?&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;not a
      drop of blood in his face, refuses broth, lies there and smiles, and keeps
      declaring he&rsquo;s perfectly well!&rsquo; He refused breakfast too. &lsquo;What is the
      matter with you, Yasha?&rsquo; she questioned him; &lsquo;do you mean to lie in bed
      all day?&rsquo; &lsquo;And what if I did?&rsquo; Aratov answered gently. This very
      gentleness again Platonida Ivanovna did not like at all. Aratov had the
      air of a man who has discovered a great, very delightful secret, and is
      jealously guarding it and keeping it to himself. He was looking forward to
      the night, not impatiently, but with curiosity. &lsquo;What next?&rsquo; he was asking
      himself; &lsquo;what will happen?&rsquo; Astonishment, incredulity, he had ceased to
      feel; he did not doubt that he was in communication with Clara, that they
      loved one another ... that, too, he had no doubt about. Only ... what
      could come of such love? He recalled that kiss ... and a delicious shiver
      ran swiftly and sweetly through all his limbs. &lsquo;Such a kiss,&rsquo; was his
      thought, &lsquo;even Romeo and Juliet knew not! But next time I will be
      stronger.... I will master her.... She shall come with a wreath of tiny
      roses in her dark curls....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what next? We cannot live together, can we? Then must I die so as to
      be with her? Is it not for that she has come; and is it not <i>so</i> she
      means to take me captive?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well; what then? If I must die, let me die. Death has no terrors for me
      now. It cannot, then, annihilate me? On the contrary, only <i>thus</i> and
      <i>there</i> can I be happy ... as I have not been happy in life, as she
      has not.... We are both pure! Oh, that kiss!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Platonida Ivanovna was incessantly coming into Aratov&rsquo;s room. She did not
      worry him with questions; she merely looked at him, muttered, sighed, and
      went out again. But he refused his dinner too: this was really too
      dreadful. The old lady set off to an acquaintance of hers, a district
      doctor, in whom she placed some confidence, simply because he did not
      drink and had a German wife. Aratov was surprised when she brought him in
      to see him; but Platonida Ivanovna so earnestly implored her darling
      Yashenka to allow Paramon Paramonitch (that was the doctor&rsquo;s name) to
      examine him&mdash;if only for her sake&mdash;that Aratov consented.
      Paramon Paramonitch felt his pulse, looked at his tongue, asked a
      question, and announced at last that it was absolutely necessary for him
      to &lsquo;auscultate&rsquo; him. Aratov was in such an amiable frame of mind that he
      agreed to this too. The doctor delicately uncovered his chest, delicately
      tapped, listened, hummed and hawed, prescribed some drops and a mixture,
      and, above all, advised him to keep quiet and avoid any excitement. &lsquo;I
      dare say!&rsquo; thought Aratov; &lsquo;that idea&rsquo;s a little too late, my good
      friend!&rsquo; &lsquo;What is wrong with Yasha?&rsquo; queried Platonida Ivanovna, as she
      slipped a three-rouble note into Paramon Paramonitch&rsquo;s hand in the
      doorway. The district doctor, who like all modern physicians&mdash;especially
      those who wear a government uniform&mdash;was fond of showing off with
      scientific terms, announced that her nephew&rsquo;s diagnosis showed all the
      symptoms of neurotic cardialgia, and there were febrile symptoms also.
      &lsquo;Speak plainer, my dear sir; do,&rsquo; cut in Platonida Ivanovna; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
      terrify me with your Latin; you&rsquo;re not in your surgery!&rsquo; &lsquo;His heart&rsquo;s not
      right,&rsquo; the doctor explained; &lsquo;and, well&mdash;there&rsquo;s a little fever too&rsquo;
      ... and he repeated his advice as to perfect quiet and absence of
      excitement. &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s no danger, is there?&rsquo; Platonida Ivanovna inquired
      severely (&lsquo;You dare rush off into Latin again,&rsquo; she implied.) &lsquo;No need to
      anticipate any at present!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor went away ... and Platonida Ivanovna grieved.... She sent to
      the surgery, though, for the medicine, which Aratov would not take, in
      spite of her entreaties. He refused any herb-tea too. &lsquo;And why are you so
      uneasy, dear?&rsquo; he said to her; &lsquo;I assure you, I&rsquo;m at this moment the
      sanest and happiest man in the whole world!&rsquo; Platonida Ivanovna could only
      shake her head. Towards evening he grew rather feverish; and still he
      insisted that she should not stay in his room, but should go to sleep in
      her own. Platonida Ivanovna obeyed; but she did not undress, and did not
      lie down. She sat in an arm-chair, and was all the while listening and
      murmuring her prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was just beginning to doze, when suddenly she was awakened by a
      terrible piercing shriek. She jumped up, rushed into Aratov&rsquo;s room, and as
      on the night before, found him lying on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not come to himself as on the previous night, in spite of all
      they could do. He fell the same night into a high fever, complicated by
      failure of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later he passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange circumstance attended his second fainting-fit. When they lifted
      him up and laid him on his bed, in his clenched right hand they found a
      small tress of a woman&rsquo;s dark hair. Where did this lock of hair come from?
      Anna Semyonovna had such a lock of hair left by Clara; but what could
      induce her to give Aratov a relic so precious to her? Could she have put
      it somewhere in the diary, and not have noticed it when she lent the book?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the delirium that preceded his death, Aratov spoke of himself as Romeo
      ... after the poison; spoke of marriage, completed and perfect; of his
      knowing now what rapture meant. Most terrible of all for Platosha was the
      minute when Aratov, coming a little to himself, and seeing her beside his
      bed, said to her, &lsquo;Aunt, what are you crying for?&mdash;because I must
      die? But don&rsquo;t you know that love is stronger than death?... Death! death!
      where is thy sting? You should not weep, but rejoice, even as I
      rejoice....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And once more on the face of the dying man shone out the rapturous smile,
      which gave the poor old woman such cruel pain.

    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      For a long time I could not get to sleep, and kept turning from side to
      side. &lsquo;Confound this foolishness about table-turning!&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;It
      simply upsets one&rsquo;s nerves.&rsquo;... Drowsiness began to overtake me at
      last....
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it seemed to me as though there were the faint and plaintive
      sound of a harp-string in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised my head. The moon was low in the sky, and looked me straight in
      the face. White as chalk lay its light upon the floor.... The strange
      sound was distinctly repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leaned on my elbow. A faint feeling of awe plucked at my heart. A minute
      passed, another.... Somewhere, far away, a cock crowed; another answered
      still more remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      I let my head sink back on the pillow. &lsquo;See what one can work oneself up
      to,&rsquo; I thought again,... &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a singing in my ears.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little while I fell asleep&mdash;or I thought I fell asleep. I had
      an extraordinary dream. I fancied I was lying in my room, in my bed&mdash;and
      was not asleep, could not even close my eyes. And again I heard the
      sound.... I turned over.... The moonlight on the floor began softly to
      lift, to rise up, to round off slightly above.... Before me; impalpable as
      mist, a white woman was standing motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; I asked with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice made answer, like the rustle of leaves: &lsquo;It is I ... I ... I ... I
      have come for you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For me? But who are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come by night to the edge of the wood where there stands an old oak-tree.
      I will be there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to look closely into the face of the mysterious woman&mdash;and
      suddenly I gave an involuntary shudder: there was a chilly breath upon me.
      And then I was not lying down, but sitting up in my bed; and where, as I
      fancied, the phantom had stood, the moonlight lay in a long streak of
      white upon the floor.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      The day passed somehow. I tried, I remember, to read, to work ...
      everything was a failure. The night came. My heart was throbbing within
      me, as though it expected something. I lay down, and turned with my face
      to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you not come?&rsquo; sounded a distinct whisper in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked round quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she ... again the mysterious phantom. Motionless eyes in a
      motionless face, and a gaze full of sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; I heard the whisper again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will come,&rsquo; I replied with instinctive horror. The phantom bent slowly
      forward, and undulating faintly like smoke, melted away altogether. And
      again the moon shone white and untroubled on the smooth floor.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      I passed the day in unrest. At supper I drank almost a whole bottle of
      wine, and all but went out on to the steps; but I turned back and flung
      myself into my bed. My blood was pulsing painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the sound was heard.... I started, but did not look round. All at
      once I felt that some one had tight hold of me from behind, and was
      whispering in my very ear: &lsquo;Come, come, come.&rsquo;... Trembling with terror, I
      moaned out: &lsquo;I will come!&rsquo; and sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman stood stooping close to my very pillow. She smiled dimly and
      vanished. I had time, though, to make out her face. It seemed to me I had
      seen her before&mdash;but where, when? I got up late, and spent the whole
      day wandering about the country. I went to the old oak at the edge of the
      forest, and looked carefully all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards evening I sat at the open window in my study. My old housekeeper
      set a cup of tea before me, but I did not touch it.... I kept asking
      myself in bewilderment: &lsquo;Am not I going out of my mind?&rsquo; The sun had just
      set: and not the sky alone was flushed with red; the whole atmosphere was
      suddenly filled with an almost unnatural purple. The leaves and grass
      never stirred, stiff as though freshly coated with varnish. In their stony
      rigidity, in the vivid sharpness of their outlines, in this combination of
      intense brightness and death-like stillness, there was something weird and
      mysterious. A rather large grey bird suddenly flew up without a sound and
      settled on the very window sill.... I looked at it, and it looked at me
      sideways with its round, dark eye. &lsquo;Were you sent to remind me, then?&rsquo; I
      wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once the bird fluttered its soft wings, and without a sound&mdash;as
      before&mdash;flew away. I sat a long time still at the window, but I was
      no longer a prey to uncertainty. I had, as it were, come within the
      enchanted circle, and I was borne along by an irresistible though gentle
      force, as a boat is borne along by the current long before it reaches the
      waterfall. I started up at last. The purple had long vanished from the
      air, the colours were darkened, and the enchanted silence was broken.
      There was the flutter of a gust of wind, the moon came out brighter and
      brighter in the sky that was growing bluer, and soon the leaves of the
      trees were weaving patterns of black and silver in her cold beams. My old
      housekeeper came into the study with a lighted candle, but there was a
      draught from the window and the flame went out. I could restrain myself no
      longer. I jumped up, clapped on my cap, and set off to the corner of the
      forest, to the old oak-tree.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      This oak had, many years before, been struck by lightning; the top of the
      tree had been shattered, and was withered up, but there was still life
      left in it for centuries to come. As I was coming up to it, a cloud passed
      over the moon: it was very dark under its thick branches. At first I
      noticed nothing special; but I glanced on one side, and my heart fairly
      failed me&mdash;a white figure was standing motionless beside a tall bush
      between the oak and the forest. My hair stood upright on my head, but I
      plucked up my courage and went towards the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was she, my visitor of the night. As I approached her, the moon
      shone out again. She seemed all, as it were, spun out of half-transparent,
      milky mist,&mdash;through her face I could see a branch faintly stirring
      in the wind; only the hair and eyes were a little dark, and on one of the
      fingers of her clasped hands a slender ring shone with a gleam of pale
      gold. I stood still before her, and tried to speak; but the voice died
      away in my throat, though it was no longer fear exactly I felt. Her eyes
      were turned upon me; their gaze expressed neither distress nor delight,
      but a sort of lifeless attention. I waited to see whether she would utter
      a word, but she remained motionless and speechless, and still gazed at me
      with her deathly intent eyes. Dread came over me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come!&rsquo; I cried at last with an effort. My voice sounded muffled
      and strange to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you,&rsquo; I heard her whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You love me!&rsquo; I repeated in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give yourself up to me, &lsquo;was whispered me again in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give myself up to you! But you are a phantom; you have no body even.&rsquo; A
      strange animation came upon me. &lsquo;What are you&mdash;smoke, air, vapour?
      Give myself up to you! Answer me first, Who are you? Have you lived upon
      the earth? Whence have you come?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give yourself up to me. I will do you no harm. Only say two words: &ldquo;Take
      me.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her. &lsquo;What is she saying?&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;What does it all mean?
      And how can she take me? Shall I try?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; I said, and unexpectedly loudly, as though some one had given
      me a push from behind; &lsquo;take me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had hardly uttered these words when the mysterious figure, with a sort
      of inward laugh, which set her face quivering for an instant, bent
      forward, and stretched out her arms wide apart.... I tried to dart away,
      but I was already in her power. She seized me, my body rose a foot from
      the ground, and we both floated smoothly and not too swiftly over the wet,
      still grass.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      At first I felt giddy, and instinctively I closed my eyes.... A minute
      later I opened them again. We were floating as before; but the forest was
      now nowhere to be seen. Under us stretched a plain, spotted here and there
      with dark patches. With horror I felt that we had risen to a fearful
      height.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am lost; I am in the power of Satan,&rsquo; flashed through me like
      lightning. Till that instant the idea of a temptation of the evil one, of
      the possibility of perdition, had never entered my head. We still whirled
      on, and seemed to be mounting higher and higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where will you take me?&rsquo; I moaned at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where you like,&rsquo; my companion answered. She clung close to me; her face
      was almost resting upon my face. But I was scarcely conscious of her
      touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me sink down to the earth, I am giddy at this height.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well; only shut your eyes and hold your breath.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed, and at once felt that I was falling like a stone flung from the
      hand ... the air whistled in my ears. When I could think again, we were
      floating smoothly once more just above the earth, so that we caught our
      feet in the tops of the tall grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put me on my feet,&rsquo; I began. &lsquo;What pleasure is there in flying? I&rsquo;m not a
      bird.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you would like it. We have no other pastime.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You? Then what are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t dare to tell me that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The plaintive sound which had awakened me the first night quivered in my
      ears. Meanwhile we were still, scarcely perceptibly, moving in the damp
      night air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go!&rsquo; I said. My companion moved slowly away, and I found myself on
      my feet. She stopped before me and again folded her hands. I grew more
      composed and looked into her face; as before it expressed submissive
      sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are we?&rsquo; I asked. I did not recognise the country about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Far from your home, but you can be there in an instant.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can that be done? by trusting myself to you again?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have done you no harm and will do you none. Let us fly till dawn, that
      is all. I can bear you away wherever you fancy&mdash;to the ends of the
      earth. Give yourself up to me! Say only: &ldquo;Take me!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well ... take me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She again pressed close to me, again my feet left the earth&mdash;and we
      were flying.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which way?&rsquo; she asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Straight on, keep straight on.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But here is a forest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lift us over the forest, only slower.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We darted upwards like a wild snipe flying up into a birch-tree, and again
      flew on in a straight line. Instead of grass, we caught glimpses of
      tree-tops just under our feet. It was strange to see the forest from
      above, its bristling back lighted up by the moon. It looked like some huge
      slumbering wild beast, and accompanied us with a vast unceasing murmur,
      like some inarticulate roar. In one place we crossed a small glade;
      intensely black was the jagged streak of shadow along one side of it. Now
      and then there was the plaintive cry of a hare below us; above us the owl
      hooted, plaintively too; there was a scent in the air of mushrooms, buds,
      and dawn-flowers; the moon fairly flooded everything on all sides with its
      cold, hard light; the Pleiades gleamed just over our heads. And now the
      forest was left behind; a streak of fog stretched out across the open
      country; it was the river. We flew along one of its banks, above the
      bushes, still and weighed down with moisture. The river&rsquo;s waters at one
      moment glimmered with a flash of blue, at another flowed on in darkness,
      as it were, in wrath. Here and there a delicate mist moved strangely over
      the water, and the water-lilies&rsquo; cups shone white in maiden pomp with
      every petal open to its full, as though they knew their safety out of
      reach. I longed to pick one of them, and behold, I found myself at once on
      the river&rsquo;s surface.... The damp air struck me an angry blow in the face,
      just as I broke the thick stalk of a great flower. We began to fly across
      from bank to bank, like the water-fowl we were continually waking up and
      chasing before us. More than once we chanced to swoop down on a family of
      wild ducks, settled in a circle on an open spot among the reeds, but they
      did not stir; at most one of them would thrust out its neck from under its
      wing, stare at us, and anxiously poke its beak away again in its fluffy
      feathers, and another faintly quacked, while its body twitched a little
      all over. We startled one heron; it flew up out of a willow bush,
      brandishing its legs and fluttering its wings with clumsy eagerness: it
      struck me as remarkably like a German. There was not the splash of a fish
      to be heard, they too were asleep. I began to get used to the sensation of
      flying, and even to find a pleasure in it; any one will understand me, who
      has experienced flying in dreams. I proceeded to scrutinise with close
      attention the strange being, by whose good offices such unlikely
      adventures had befallen me.

      She was a woman with a small un-Russian face. Greyish-white,
      half-transparent, with scarcely marked shades, she reminded one of the
      alabaster figures on a vase lighted up within, and again her face seemed
      familiar to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can I speak with you?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see a ring on your finger; you have lived then on the earth, you have
      been married?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited ... There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is your name, or, at least, what was it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call me Alice.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice! That&rsquo;s an English name! Are you an Englishwoman? Did you know me
      in former days?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why is it then you have come to me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And are you content?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; we float, we whirl together in the fresh air.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice!&rsquo; I said all at once, &lsquo;you are perhaps a sinful, condemned soul?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My companion&rsquo;s head bent towards me. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rsquo; she
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I adjure you in God&rsquo;s name....&rsquo; I was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you saying?&rsquo; she put in in perplexity. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancied that the arm that lay like a chilly girdle about my waist softly
      trembled....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid, my dear one!&rsquo; Her face
      turned and moved towards my face.... I felt on my lips a strange
      sensation, like the faintest prick of a soft and delicate sting....
      Leeches might prick so in mild and drowsy mood.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      I glanced downwards. We had now risen again to a considerable height. We
      were flying over some provincial town I did not know, situated on the side
      of a wide slope. Churches rose up high among the dark mass of wooden roofs
      and orchards; a long bridge stood out black at the bend of a river;
      everything was hushed, buried in slumber. The very crosses and cupolas
      seemed to gleam with a silent brilliance; silently stood the tall posts of
      the wells beside the round tops of the willows; silently the straight
      whitish road darted arrow-like into one end of the town, and silently it
      ran out again at the opposite end on to the dark waste of monotonous
      fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What town is this?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;X....&rsquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;X ... in Y ... province?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a long distance indeed from home!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Distance is not for us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really?&rsquo; I was fired by a sudden recklessness. &lsquo;Then take me to South
      America!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To America I cannot. It&rsquo;s daylight there by now.&rsquo; &lsquo;And we are
      night-birds. Well, anywhere, where you can, only far, far away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shut your eyes and hold your breath,&rsquo; answered Alice, and we flew along
      with the speed of a whirlwind. With a deafening noise the air rushed into
      my ears. We stopped, but the noise did not cease. On the contrary, it
      changed into a sort of menacing roar, the roll of thunder...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now you can open your eyes,&rsquo; said Alice.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IX
    </h3>
    <p>
      I obeyed ... Good God, where was I?
    </p>
    <p>
      Overhead, ponderous, smoke-like storm-clouds; they huddled, they moved on
      like a herd of furious monsters ... and there below, another monster; a
      raging, yes, raging, sea ... The white foam gleamed with spasmodic fury,
      and surged up in hillocks upon it, and hurling up shaggy billows, it beat
      with a sullen roar against a huge cliff, black as pitch. The howling of
      the tempest, the chilling gasp of the storm-rocked abyss, the weighty
      splash of the breakers, in which from time to time one fancied something
      like a wail, like distant cannon-shots, like a bell ringing&mdash;the
      tearing crunch and grind of the shingle on the beach, the sudden shriek of
      an unseen gull, on the murky horizon the disabled hulk of a ship&mdash;on
      every side death, death and horror.... Giddiness overcame me, and I shut
      my eyes again with a sinking heart....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this? Where are we?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the south coast of the Isle of Wight opposite the Blackgang cliff
      where ships are so often wrecked,&rsquo; said Alice, speaking this time with
      peculiar distinctness, and as it seemed to me with a certain malignant
      pleasure....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take me away, away from here ... home! home!&rsquo; I shrank up, hid my face in
      my hands ... I felt that we were moving faster than before; the wind now
      was not roaring or moaning, it whistled in my hair, in my clothes ... I
      caught my breath ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand on your feet now,&rsquo; I heard Alice&rsquo;s voice saying. I tried to master
      myself, to regain consciousness ... I felt the earth under the soles of my
      feet, and I heard nothing, as though everything had swooned away about me
      ... only in my temples the blood throbbed irregularly, and my head was
      still giddy with a faint ringing in my ears. I drew myself up and opened
      my eyes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      X
    </h3>
    <p>
      We were on the bank of my pond. Straight before me there were glimpses
      through the pointed leaves of the willows of its broad surface with
      threads of fluffy mist clinging here and there upon it. To the right a
      field of rye shone dimly; on the left stood up my orchard trees, tall,
      rigid, drenched it seemed in dew ... The breath of the morning was already
      upon them. Across the pure grey sky stretched like streaks of smoke, two
      or three slanting clouds; they had a yellowish tinge, the first faint glow
      of dawn fell on them; one could not say whence it came; the eye could not
      detect on the horizon, which was gradually growing lighter, the spot where
      the sun was to rise. The stars had disappeared; nothing was astir yet,
      though everything was already on the point of awakening in the enchanted
      stillness of the morning twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Morning! see, it is morning!&rsquo; cried Alice in my ear. &lsquo;Farewell till
      to-morrow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned round ... Lightly rising from the earth, she floated by, and
      suddenly she raised both hands above her head. The head and hands and
      shoulders glowed for an instant with warm, corporeal light; living sparks
      gleamed in the dark eyes; a smile of mysterious tenderness stirred the
      reddening lips.... A lovely woman had suddenly arisen before me.... But as
      though dropping into a swoon, she fell back instantly and melted away like
      vapour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remained passive.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I recovered myself and looked round me, it seemed to me that the
      corporeal, pale-rosy colour that had flitted over the figure of my phantom
      had not yet vanished, and was enfolding me, diffused in the air.... It was
      the flush of dawn. All at once I was conscious of extreme fatigue and
      turned homewards. As I passed the poultry-yard, I heard the first morning
      cackling of the geese (no birds wake earlier than they do); along the roof
      at the end of each beam sat a rook, and they were all busily and silently
      pluming themselves, standing out in sharp outline against the milky sky.
      From time to time they all rose at once, and after a short flight, settled
      again in a row, without uttering a caw.... From the wood close by came
      twice repeated the drowsy, fresh chuck-chuck of the black-cock, beginning
      to fly into the dewy grass, overgrown by brambles.... With a faint tremor
      all over me I made my way to my bed, and soon fell into a sound sleep.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XI
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next night, as I was approaching the old oak, Alice moved to meet me,
      as if I were an old friend. I was not afraid of her as I had been the day
      before, I was almost rejoiced at seeing her; I did not even attempt to
      comprehend what was happening to me; I was simply longing to fly farther
      to interesting places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice&rsquo;s arm again twined about me, and we took flight again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us go to Italy,&rsquo; I whispered in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wherever you wish, my dear one,&rsquo; she answered solemnly and slowly, and
      slowly and solemnly she turned her face towards me. It struck me as less
      transparent than on the eve; more woman-like and more imposing; it
      recalled to me the being I had had a glimpse of in the early dawn at
      parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This night is a great night,&rsquo; Alice went on. &lsquo;It comes rarely&mdash;when
      seven times thirteen ...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point I could not catch a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-night we can see what is hidden at other times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice!&rsquo; I implored, &lsquo;but who are you, tell me at last?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently she lifted her long white hand. In the dark sky, where her finger
      was pointing, a comet flashed, a reddish streak among the tiny stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How am I to understand you?&rsquo; I began, &lsquo;Or, as that comet floats between
      the planets and the sun, do you float among men ... or what?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alice&rsquo;s hand was suddenly passed before my eyes.... It was as though a
      white mist from the damp valley had fallen on me....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Italy! to Italy!&rsquo; I heard her whisper. &lsquo;This night is a great night!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      XII
    </h3>
    <p>
      The mist cleared away from before my eyes, and I saw below me an immense
      plain. But already, by the mere breath of the warm soft air upon my
      cheeks, I could tell I was not in Russia; and the plain, too, was not like
      our Russian plains. It was a vast dark expanse, apparently desert and not
      overgrown with grass; here and there over its whole extent gleamed pools
      of water, like broken pieces of looking-glass; in the distance could be
      dimly descried a noiseless motionless sea. Great stars shone bright in the
      spaces between the big beautiful clouds; the murmur of thousands, subdued
      but never-ceasing, rose on all sides, and very strange was this shrill but
      drowsy chorus, this voice of the darkness and the desert....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Pontine marshes,&rsquo; said Alice. &lsquo;Do you hear the frogs? do you smell
      the sulphur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Pontine marshes....&rsquo; I repeated, and a sense of grandeur and of
      desolation came upon me. &lsquo;But why have you brought me here, to this gloomy
      forsaken place? Let us fly to Rome instead.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rome is near,&rsquo; answered Alice.... &lsquo;Prepare yourself!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We sank lower, and flew along an ancient Roman road. A bullock slowly
      lifted from the slimy mud its shaggy monstrous head, with short tufts of
      bristles between its crooked backward-bent horns. It turned the whites of
      its dull malignant eyes askance, and sniffed a heavy snorting breath into
      its wet nostrils, as though scenting us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rome, Rome is near...&rsquo; whispered Alice. &lsquo;Look, look in front....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the blur of black on the edge of the night sky? Were these the
      lofty arches of an immense bridge? What river did it span? Why was it
      broken down in parts? No, it was not a bridge, it was an ancient aqueduct.
      All around was the holy ground of the Campagna, and there, in the
      distance, the Albanian hills, and their peaks and the grey ridge of the
      old aqueduct gleamed dimly in the beams of the rising moon....
    </p>
    <p>
      We suddenly darted upwards, and floated in the air before a deserted ruin.
      No one could have said what it had been: sepulchre, palace, or castle....
      Dark ivy encircled it all over in its deadly clasp, and below gaped
      yawning a half-ruined vault. A heavy underground smell rose in my face
      from this heap of tiny closely-fitted stones, whence the granite facing of
      the wall had long crumbled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; Alice pronounced, and she raised her hand: &lsquo;Here! call aloud three
      times running the name of the mighty Roman!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What will happen?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will see.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered. &lsquo;<i>Divus Caius Julius Caesar!</i>&rsquo; I cried suddenly; &lsquo;<i>Divus
      Caius Julius Caesar!</i>&rsquo; I repeated deliberately; &lsquo;<i>Caesar!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      The last echoes of my voice had hardly died away, when I heard....
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to say what I did hear. At first there reached me a
      confused din the ear could scarcely catch, the endlessly-repeated clamour
      of the blare of trumpets, and the clapping of hands. It seemed that
      somewhere, immensely far away, at some fathomless depth, a multitude
      innumerable was suddenly astir, and was rising up, rising up in agitation,
      calling to one another, faintly, as if muffled in sleep, the suffocating
      sleep of ages. Then the air began moving in dark currents over the
      ruin.... Shades began flitting before me, myriads of shades, millions of
      outlines, the rounded curves of helmets, the long straight lines of
      lances; the moonbeams were broken into momentary gleams of blue upon these
      helmets and lances, and all this army, this multitude, came closer and
      closer, and grew, in more and more rapid movement.... An indescribable
      force, a force fit to set the whole world moving, could be felt in it; but
      not one figure stood out clearly.... And suddenly I fancied a sort of
      tremor ran all round, as if it were the rush and rolling apart of some
      huge waves.... &lsquo;<i>Caesar, Caesar venit!</i>&rsquo; sounded voices, like the
      leaves of a forest when a storm has suddenly broken upon it ... a muffled
      shout thundered through the multitude, and a pale stern head, in a wreath
      of laurel, with downcast eyelids, the head of the emperor, began slowly to
      rise out of the ruin....
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no word in the tongue of man to express the horror which clutched
      at my heart.... I felt that were that head to raise its eyes, to part its
      lips, I must perish on the spot! &lsquo;Alice!&rsquo; I moaned, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t, I
      don&rsquo;t want Rome, coarse, terrible Rome.... Away, away from here!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coward!&rsquo; she whispered, and away we flew. I just had time to hear behind
      me the iron voice of the legions, like a peal of thunder ... then all was
      darkness.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIV
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look round,&rsquo; Alice said to me, &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t fear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed&mdash;and, I remember, my first impression was so sweet that I
      could only sigh. A sort of smoky-grey, silvery-soft, half-light,
      half-mist, enveloped me on all sides. At first I made out nothing: I was
      dazzled by this azure brilliance; but little by little began to emerge the
      outlines of beautiful mountains and forests; a lake lay at my feet, with
      stars quivering in its depths, and the musical plash of waves. The
      fragrance of orange flowers met me with a rush, and with it&mdash;and also
      as it were with a rush&mdash;came floating the pure powerful notes of a
      woman&rsquo;s young voice. This fragrance, this music, fairly drew me downwards,
      and I began to sink ... to sink down towards a magnificent marble palace,
      which stood, invitingly white, in the midst of a wood of cypress. The
      music flowed out from its wide open windows, the waves of the lake,
      flecked with the pollen of flowers, splashed upon its walls, and just
      opposite, all clothed in the dark green of orange flowers and laurels,
      enveloped in shining mist, and studded with statues, slender columns, and
      the porticoes of temples, a lofty round island rose out of the water....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isola Bella!&rsquo; said Alice.... &lsquo;Lago Maggiore....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I murmured only &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; and continued to drop. The woman&rsquo;s voice sounded
      louder and clearer in the palace; I was irresistibly drawn towards it....
      I wanted to look at the face of the singer, who, in such music, gave voice
      to such a night. We stood still before the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of a room, furnished in the style of Pompeii, and more like
      an ancient temple than a modern drawing-room, surrounded by Greek statues,
      Etruscan vases, rare plants, and precious stuffs, lighted up by the soft
      radiance of two lamps enclosed in crystal globes, a young woman was
      sitting at the piano. Her head slightly bowed and her eyes half-closed,
      she sang an Italian melody; she sang and smiled, and at the same time her
      face wore an expression of gravity, almost of sternness ... a token of
      perfect rapture! She smiled ... and Praxiteles&rsquo; Faun, indolent, youthful
      as she, effeminate, and voluptuous, seemed to smile back at her from a
      corner, under the branches of an oleander, across the delicate smoke that
      curled upwards from a bronze censer on an antique tripod. The beautiful
      singer was alone. Spell-bound by the music, her beauty, the splendour and
      sweet fragrance of the night, moved to the heart by the picture of this
      youthful, serene, and untroubled happiness, I utterly forgot my companion,
      I forgot the strange way in which I had become a witness of this life, so
      remote, so completely apart from me, and I was on the point of tapping at
      the window, of speaking....
    </p>
    <p>
      I was set trembling all over by a violent shock&mdash;just as though I had
      touched a galvanic battery. I looked round.... The face of Alice was&mdash;for
      all its transparency&mdash;dark and menacing; there was a dull glow of
      anger in her eyes, which were suddenly wide and round....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Away!&rsquo; she murmured wrathfully, and again whirling and darkness and
      giddiness.... Only this time not the shout of legions, but the voice of
      the singer, breaking on a high note, lingered in my ears....
    </p>
    <p>
      We stopped. The high note, the same note was still ringing and did not
      cease to ring in my ears, though I was breathing quite a different air, a
      different scent ... a breeze was blowing upon me, fresh and invigorating,
      as though from a great river, and there was a smell of hay, smoke and
      hemp. The long-drawn-out note was followed by a second, and a third, but
      with an expression so unmistakable, a trill so familiar, so peculiarly our
      own, that I said to myself at once: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a Russian singing a Russian
      song!&rsquo; and at that very instant everything grew clear about me.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XV
    </h3>
    <p>
      We found ourselves on a flat riverside plain. To the left, newly-mown
      meadows, with rows of huge hayricks, stretched endlessly till they were
      lost in the distance; to the right extended the smooth surface of a vast
      mighty river, till it too was lost in the distance. Not far from the bank,
      big dark barges slowly rocked at anchor, slightly tilting their slender
      masts, like pointing fingers. From one of these barges came floating up to
      me the sounds of a liquid voice, and a fire was burning in it, throwing a
      long red light that danced and quivered on the water. Here and there, both
      on the river and in the fields, other lights were glimmering, whether
      close at hand or far away, the eye could not distinguish; they shrank
      together, then suddenly lengthened out into great blurs of light;
      grasshoppers innumerable kept up an unceasing churr, persistent as the
      frogs of the Pontine marshes; and across the cloudless, but dark lowering
      sky floated from time to time the cries of unseen birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are we in Russia?&rsquo; I asked of Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the Volga,&rsquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      We flew along the river-bank. &lsquo;Why did you tear me away from there, from
      that lovely country?&rsquo; I began. &lsquo;Were you envious, or was it jealousy in
      you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lips of Alice faintly stirred, and again there was a menacing light in
      her eyes.... But her whole face grew stony again at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to go home,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a little, wait a little,&rsquo; answered Alice. &lsquo;To-night is a great
      night. It will not soon return. You may be a spectator.... Wait a little.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And we suddenly flew across the Volga in a slanting direction, keeping
      close to the water&rsquo;s surface, with the low impetuous flight of swallows
      before a storm. The broad waves murmured heavily below us, the sharp river
      breeze beat upon us with its strong cold wing ... the high right bank
      began soon to rise up before us in the half-darkness. Steep mountains
      appeared with great ravines between. We came near to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shout: &ldquo;Lads, to the barges!&rdquo;&rsquo; Alice whispered to me. I remembered the
      terror I had suffered at the apparition of the Roman phantoms. I felt
      weary and strangely heavy, as though my heart were ebbing away within me.
      I wished not to utter the fatal words; I knew beforehand that in response
      to them there would appear, as in the wolves&rsquo; valley of the Freischütz,
      some monstrous thing; but my lips parted against my will, and in a weak
      forced voice I shouted, also against my will: &lsquo;Lads, to the barges!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVI
    </h3>
    <p>
      At first all was silence, even as it was at the Roman ruins, but suddenly
      I heard close to my very ear a coarse bargeman&rsquo;s laugh, and with a moan
      something dropped into the water and a gurgling sound followed.... I
      looked round: no one was anywhere to be seen, but from the bank the echo
      came bounding back, and at once from all sides rose a deafening din. There
      was a medley of everything in this chaos of sound: shouting and whining,
      furious abuse and laughter, laughter above everything; the plash of oars
      and the cleaving of hatchets, a crash as of the smashing of doors and
      chests, the grating of rigging and wheels, and the neighing of horses, and
      the clang of the alarm bell and the clink of chains, the roar and crackle
      of fire, drunken songs and quick, gnashing chatter, weeping inconsolable,
      plaintive despairing prayers, and shouts of command, the dying gasp and
      the reckless whistle, the guffaw and the thud of the dance.... &lsquo;Kill them!
      Hang them! Drown them! rip them up! bravo! bravo! don&rsquo;t spare them!&rsquo; could
      be heard distinctly; I could even hear the hurried breathing of men
      panting. And meanwhile all around, as far as the eye could reach, nothing
      could be seen, nothing was changed; the river rolled by mysteriously,
      almost sullenly, the very bank seemed more deserted and desolate&mdash;and
      that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to Alice, but she put her finger to her lips....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stepan Timofeitch! Stepan Timofeitch is coming!&rsquo; was shouted noisily all
      round; &lsquo;he is coming, our father, our ataman, our bread-giver!&rsquo; As before
      I saw nothing but it seemed to me as though a huge body were moving
      straight at me.... &lsquo;Frolka! where art thou, dog?&rsquo; thundered an awful
      voice. &lsquo;Set fire to every corner at once&mdash;and to the hatchet with
      them, the white-handed scoundrels!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt the hot breath of the flame close by, and tasted the bitter savour
      of the smoke; and at the same instant something warm like blood spurted
      over my face and hands.... A savage roar of laughter broke out all
      round....
    </p>
    <p>
      I lost consciousness, and when I came to myself, Alice and I were gliding
      along beside the familiar bushes that bordered my wood, straight towards
      the old oak....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you see the little path?&rsquo; Alice said to me, &lsquo;where the moon shines
      dimly and where are two birch-trees overhanging? Will you go there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I felt so shattered and exhausted that I could only say in reply:
      &lsquo;Home! home!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are at home,&rsquo; replied Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in fact standing at the very door of my house&mdash;alone. Alice had
      vanished. The yard-dog was about to approach, he scanned me suspiciously&mdash;and
      with a bark ran away.
    </p>
    <p>
      With difficulty I dragged myself up to my bed and fell asleep without
      undressing.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVII
    </h3>
    <p>
      All the following morning my head ached, and I could scarcely move my
      legs; but I cared little for my bodily discomfort; I was devoured by
      regret, overwhelmed with vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was excessively annoyed with myself. &lsquo;Coward!&rsquo; I repeated incessantly;
      &lsquo;yes&mdash;Alice was right. What was I frightened of? how could I miss
      such an opportunity?... I might have seen Cæsar himself&mdash;and I was
      senseless with terror, I whimpered and turned away, like a child at the
      sight of the rod. Razin, now&mdash;that&rsquo;s another matter. As a nobleman
      and landowner ... though, indeed, even then what had I really to fear?
      Coward! coward!&rsquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But wasn&rsquo;t it all a dream?&rsquo; I asked myself at last. I called my
      housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Marfa, what o&rsquo;clock did I go to bed yesterday&mdash;do you remember?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, who can tell, master?... Late enough, surely. Before it was quite
      dark you went out of the house; and you were tramping about in your
      bedroom when the night was more than half over. Just on morning&mdash;yes.
      And this is the third day it&rsquo;s been the same. You&rsquo;ve something on your
      mind, it&rsquo;s easy to see.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha-ha!&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;Then there&rsquo;s no doubt about the flying. Well, and
      how do I look to-day?&rsquo; I added aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you look? Let me have a look at you. You&rsquo;ve got thinner a bit.
      Yes, and you&rsquo;re pale, master; to be sure, there&rsquo;s not a drop of blood in
      your face.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt a slight twinge of uneasiness.... I dismissed Marfa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, going on like this, you&rsquo;ll die, or go out of your mind, perhaps,&rsquo; I
      reasoned with myself, as I sat deep in thought at the window. &lsquo;I must give
      it all up. It&rsquo;s dangerous. And now my heart beats so strangely. And when I
      fly, I keep feeling as though some one were sucking at it, or as it were
      drawing something out of it&mdash;as the spring sap is drawn out of the
      birch-tree, if you stick an axe into it. I&rsquo;m sorry, though. And Alice
      too.... She is playing cat and mouse with me ... still she can hardly wish
      me harm. I will give myself up to her for the last time&mdash;and then....
      But if she is drinking my blood? That&rsquo;s awful. Besides, such rapid
      locomotion cannot fail to be injurious; even in England, I&rsquo;m told, on the
      railways, it&rsquo;s against the law to go more than one hundred miles an
      hour....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I reasoned with myself&mdash;but at ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening, I was
      already at my post before the old oak-tree.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      The night was cold, dull, grey; there was a feeling of rain in the air. To
      my amazement, I found no one under the oak; I walked several times round
      it, went up to the edge of the wood, turned back again, peered anxiously
      into the darkness.... All was emptiness. I waited a little, then several
      times I uttered the name, Alice, each time a little louder,... but she did
      not appear. I felt sad, almost sick at heart; my previous apprehensions
      vanished; I could not resign myself to the idea that my companion would
      not come back to me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice! Alice! come! Can it be you will not come?&rsquo; I shouted, for the last
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crow, who had been waked by my voice, suddenly darted upwards into a
      tree-top close by, and catching in the twigs, fluttered his wings.... But
      Alice did not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      With downcast head, I turned homewards. Already I could discern the black
      outlines of the willows on the pond&rsquo;s edge, and the light in my window
      peeped out at me through the apple-trees in the orchard&mdash;peeped at
      me, and hid again, like the eye of some man keeping watch on me&mdash;when
      suddenly I heard behind me the faint swish of the rapidly parted air, and
      something at once embraced and snatched me upward, as a buzzard pounces on
      and snatches up a quail.... It was Alice sweeping down upon me. I felt her
      cheek against my cheek, her enfolding arm about my body, and like a
      cutting cold her whisper pierced to my ear, &lsquo;Here I am.&rsquo; I was frightened
      and delighted both at once.... We flew at no great height above the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did not mean to come to-day?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you were dull without me? You love me? Oh, you are mine!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words of Alice confused me.... I did not know what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was kept,&rsquo; she went on; &lsquo;I was watched.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who could keep you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where would you like to go?&rsquo; inquired Alice, as usual not answering my
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take me to Italy&mdash;to that lake, you remember.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice turned a little away, and shook her head in refusal. At that point I
      noticed for the first time that she had ceased to be transparent. And her
      face seemed tinged with colour; there was a faint glow of red over its
      misty whiteness. I glanced at her eyes ... and felt a pang of dread; in
      those eyes something was astir&mdash;with the slow, continuous, malignant
      movement of the benumbed snake, twisting and turning as the sun begins to
      thaw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;who are you? Tell me who you are.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice simply shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt angry ... I longed to punish her; and suddenly the idea occurred to
      me to tell her to fly with me to Paris. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the place for you to be
      jealous,&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;Alice,&rsquo; I said aloud, &lsquo;you are not afraid of big
      towns&mdash;Paris, for instance?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even those parts where it is as light as in the boulevards?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not the light of day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good; then take me at once to the Boulevard des Italiens.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice wrapped the end of her long hanging sleeve about my head. I was at
      once enfolded in a sort of white vapour full of the drowsy fragrance of
      the poppy. Everything disappeared at once; every light, every sound, and
      almost consciousness itself. Only the sense of being alive remained, and
      that was not unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the vapour vanished; Alice took her sleeve from my head, and I
      saw at my feet a huge mass of closely&mdash;packed buildings, brilliant
      light, movement, noisy traffic.... I saw Paris.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIX
    </h3>
    <p>
      I had been in Paris before, and so I recognised at once the place to which
      Alice had directed her course. It was the Garden of the Tuileries with its
      old chestnut-trees, its iron railings, its fortress moat, and its
      brutal-looking Zouave sentinels. Passing the palace, passing the Church of
      St. Roche, on the steps of which the first Napoleon for the first time
      shed French blood, we came to a halt high over the Boulevard des Italiens,
      where the third Napoleon did the same thing and with the same success.
      Crowds of people, dandies young and old, workmen in blouses, women in
      gaudy dresses, were thronging on the pavements; the gilded restaurants and
      cafés were flaring with lights; omnibuses, carriages of all sorts and
      shapes, moved to and fro along the boulevard; everything was bustle,
      everything was brightness, wherever one chanced to look.... But, strange
      to say, I had no inclination to forsake my pure dark airy height. I had no
      inclination to get nearer to this human ant-hill. It seemed as though a
      hot, heavy, reddish vapour rose from it, half-fragrance, half-stench; so
      many lives were flung struggling in one heap together there. I was
      hesitating.... But suddenly, sharp as the clang of iron bars, the voice of
      a harlot of the streets floated up to me; like an insolent tongue, it was
      thrust out, this voice; it stung me like the sting of a viper. At once I
      saw in imagination the strong, heavy-jawed, greedy, flat Parisian face,
      the mercenary eyes, the paint and powder, the frizzed hair, and the
      nosegay of gaudy artificial flowers under the high-pointed hat, the
      polished nails like talons, the hideous crinoline.... I could fancy too
      one of our sons of the steppes running with pitiful eagerness after the
      doll put up for sale.... I could fancy him with clumsy coarseness and
      violent stammering, trying to imitate the manners of the waiters at
      Véfour&rsquo;s, mincing, flattering, wheedling ... and a feeling of loathing
      gained possession of me.... &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;here Alice has no need to be
      jealous....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile I perceived that we had gradually begun to descend.... Paris was
      rising to meet us with all its din and odour....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; I said to Alice. &lsquo;Are you not stifled and oppressed here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You asked me to bring you here yourself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am to blame, I take back my word. Take me away, Alice, I beseech you.
      To be sure, here is Prince Kulmametov hobbling along the boulevard; and
      his friend, Serge Varaksin, waves his hand to him, shouting: &ldquo;Ivan
      Stepanitch, <i>allons souper</i>, make haste, zhay angazha Rigol-bouche
      itself!&rdquo; Take me away from these furnished apartments and <i>maisons
      dorées</i>, from the Jockey Club and the Figaro, from close-shaven
      military heads and varnished barracks, from sergents-de-ville with
      Napoleonic beards, and from glasses of muddy absinthe, from gamblers
      playing dominoes at the cafés, and gamblers on the Bourse, from red
      ribbons in button-holes, from M. de Four, inventor of &lsquo;matrimonial
      specialities,&rsquo; and the gratuitous consultations of Dr. Charles Albert,
      from liberal lectures and government pamphlets, from Parisian comedies and
      Parisian operas, from Parisian wit and Parisian ignorance.... Away! away!
      away!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look down,&rsquo; Alice answered; &lsquo;you are not now in Paris.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I lowered my eyes.... It was true. A dark plain, intersected here and
      there by the whitish lines of roads, was rushing rapidly by below us, and
      only behind us on the horizon, like the reflection of an immense
      conflagration, rose the great glow of the innumerable lights of the
      capital of the world.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XX
    </h3>
    <p>
      Again a veil fell over my eyes.... Again I lost consciousness. The veil
      was withdrawn at last. What was it down there below? What was this park,
      with avenues of lopped lime-trees, with isolated fir-trees of the shape of
      parasols, with porticoes and temples in the Pompadour style, with statues
      of satyrs and nymphs of the Bernini school, with rococo tritons in the
      midst of meandering lakes, closed in by low parapets of blackened marble?
      Wasn&rsquo;t it Versailles? No, it was not Versailles. A small palace, also
      rococo, peeped out behind a clump of bushy oaks. The moon shone dimly,
      shrouded in mist, and over the earth there was, as it were spread out, a
      delicate smoke. The eye could not decide what it was, whether moonlight or
      fog. On one of the lakes a swan was asleep; its long back was white as the
      snow of the frost-bound steppes, while glow-worms gleamed like diamonds in
      the bluish shadow at the base of a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are near Mannheim,&rsquo; said Alice; &lsquo;this is the Schwetzingen garden.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are in Germany,&rsquo; I thought, and I fell to listening. All was silence,
      except somewhere, secluded and unseen, the splash and babble of falling
      water. It seemed continually to repeat the same words: &lsquo;Aye, aye, aye, for
      aye, aye.&rsquo; And all at once I fancied that in the very centre of one of the
      avenues, between clipped walls of green, a cavalier came tripping along in
      red-heeled boots, a gold-braided coat, with lace ruffs at his wrists, a
      light steel rapier at his thigh, smilingly offering his arm to a lady in a
      powdered wig and a gay chintz.... Strange, pale faces.... I tried to look
      into them.... But already everything had vanished, and as before there was
      nothing but the babbling water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those are dreams wandering,&rsquo; whispered Alice; &lsquo;yesterday there was much&mdash;oh,
      much&mdash;to see; to-day, even the dreams avoid man&rsquo;s eye. Forward!
      forward!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We soared higher and flew farther on. So smooth and easy was our flight
      that it seemed that we moved not, but everything moved to meet us.
      Mountains came into view, dark, undulating, covered with forest; they rose
      up and swam towards us.... And now they were slipping by beneath us, with
      all their windings, hollows, and narrow glades, with gleams of light from
      rapid brooks among the slumbering trees at the bottom of the dales; and in
      front of us more mountains sprung up again and floated towards us.... We
      were in the heart of the Black Forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mountains, still mountains ... and forest, magnificent, ancient, stately
      forest. The night sky was clear; I could recognise some kinds of trees,
      especially the splendid firs, with their straight white trunks. Here and
      there on the edge of the forest, wild goats could be seen; graceful and
      alert, they stood on their slender legs and listened, turning their heads
      prettily and pricking up their great funnel-shaped ears. A ruined tower,
      sightless and gloomy, on the crest of a bare cliff, laid bare its
      crumbling turrets; above the old forgotten stones, a little golden star
      was shining peacefully. From a small almost black lake rose, like a
      mysterious wail, the plaintive croak of tiny frogs. I fancied other notes,
      long-drawn-out, languid like the strains of an Æolian harp.... Here we
      were in the home of legend! The same delicate moonlight mist, which had
      struck me in Schwetzingen, was shed here on every side, and the farther
      away the mountains, the thicker was this mist. I counted up five, six, ten
      different tones of shadow at different heights on the mountain slopes, and
      over all this realm of varied silence the moon queened it pensively. The
      air blew in soft, light currents. I felt myself a lightness at heart, and,
      as it were, a lofty calm and melancholy....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice, you must love this country!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love nothing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How so? Not me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes ... you!&rsquo; she answered indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that her arm clasped my waist more tightly than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forward! forward!&rsquo; said Alice, with a sort of cold fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forward!&rsquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <h3>

    <p>
      A loud, thrilling cry rang out suddenly over our heads, and was at once
      repeated a little in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those are belated cranes flying to you, to the north,&rsquo; said Alice; &lsquo;would
      you like to join them?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes! raise me up to them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We darted upwards and in one instant found ourselves beside the flying
      flock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big handsome birds (there were thirteen of them) were flying in a
      triangle, with slow sharp flaps of their hollow wings; with their heads
      and legs stretched rigidly out, and their breasts stiffly pressed forward,
      they pushed on persistently and so swiftly that the air whistled about
      them. It was marvellous at such a height, so remote from all things
      living, to see such passionate, strenuous life, such unflinching will,
      untiringly cleaving their triumphant way through space. The cranes now and
      then called to one another, the foremost to the hindmost; and there was a
      certain pride, dignity, and invincible faith in these loud cries, this
      converse in the clouds. &lsquo;We shall get there, be sure, hard though it be,&rsquo;
      they seemed to say, cheering one another on. And then the thought came to
      me that men, such as these birds&mdash;in Russia&mdash;nay, in the whole
      world, are few.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are flying towards Russia now,&rsquo; observed Alice. I noticed now, not for
      the first time, that she almost always knew what I was thinking of. &lsquo;Would
      you like to go back?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us go back ... or no! I have been in Paris; take me to Petersburg.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At once.... Only wrap my head in your veil, or it will go ill with me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice raised her hand ... but before the mist enfolded me, I had time to
      feel on my lips the contact of that soft, dull sting....
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXII
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Li-i-isten!&rsquo; sounded in my ears a long drawn out cry. &lsquo;Li-i-isten!&rsquo; was
      echoed back with a sort of desperation in the distance. &lsquo;Li-i-isten!&rsquo; died
      away somewhere far, far away. I started. A tall golden spire flashed on my
      eyes; I recognised the fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      A northern, pale night! But was it night at all? Was it not rather a
      pallid, sickly daylight? I never liked Petersburg nights; but this time
      the night seemed even fearful to me; the face of Alice had vanished
      completely, melted away like the mist of morning in the July sun, and I
      saw her whole body clearly, as it hung, heavy and solitary on a level with
      the Alexander column. So here was Petersburg! Yes, it was Petersburg, no
      doubt. The wide empty grey streets; the greyish-white, and yellowish-grey
      and greyish-lilac houses, covered with stucco, which was peeling off, with
      their sunken windows, gaudy sign-boards, iron canopies over steps, and
      wretched little green-grocer&rsquo;s shops; the façades, inscriptions,
      sentry-boxes, troughs; the golden cap of St. Isaac&rsquo;s; the senseless motley
      Bourse; the granite walls of the fortress, and the broken wooden pavement;
      the barges loaded with hay and timber; the smell of dust, cabbage,
      matting, and hemp; the stony-faced dvorniks in sheepskin coats, with high
      collars; the cab-drivers, huddled up dead asleep on their decrepit cabs&mdash;yes,
      this was Petersburg, our northern Palmyra. Everything was visible;
      everything was clear&mdash;cruelly clear and distinct&mdash;and everything
      was mournfully sleeping, standing out in strange huddled masses in the
      dull clear air. The flush of sunset&mdash;a hectic flush&mdash;had not yet
      gone, and would not be gone till morning from the white starless sky; it
      was reflected on the silken surface of the Neva, while faintly gurgling
      and faintly moving, the cold blue waves hurried on....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us fly away,&rsquo; Alice implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      And without waiting for my reply, she bore me away across the Neva, over
      the palace square to Liteiny Street. Steps and voices were audible beneath
      us; a group of young men, with worn faces, came along the street talking
      about dancing-classes. &lsquo;Sub-lieutenant Stolpakov&rsquo;s seventh!&rsquo; shouted
      suddenly a soldier, standing half-asleep on guard at a pyramid of rusty
      bullets; and a little farther on, at an open window in a tall house, I saw
      a girl in a creased silk dress, without cuffs, with a pearl net on her
      hair, and a cigarette in her mouth. She was reading a book with reverent
      attention; it was a volume of the works of one of our modern Juvenals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us fly away!&rsquo; I said to Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      One instant more, and there were glimpses below us of the rotting pine
      copses and mossy bogs surrounding Petersburg. We bent our course straight
      to the south; sky, earth, all grew gradually darker and darker. The sick
      night; the sick daylight; the sick town&mdash;all were left behind us.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      We flew more slowly than usual, and I was able to follow with my eyes the
      immense expanse of my native land gradually unfolding before me, like the
      unrolling of an endless panorama. Forests, copses, fields, ravines, rivers&mdash;here
      and there villages and churches&mdash;and again fields and forests and
      copses and ravines.... Sadness came over me, and a kind of indifferent
      dreariness. And I was not sad and dreary simply because it was Russia I
      was flying over. No. The earth itself, this flat surface which lay spread
      out beneath me; the whole earthly globe, with its populations,
      multitudinous, feeble, crushed by want, grief and diseases, bound to a
      clod of pitiful dust; this brittle, rough crust, this shell over the fiery
      sands of our planet, overspread with the mildew we call the organic,
      vegetable kingdom; these human flies, a thousand times paltrier than
      flies; their dwellings glued together with filth, the pitiful traces of
      their tiny, monotonous bustle, of their comic struggle with the unchanging
      and inevitable, how revolting it all suddenly was to me. My heart turned
      slowly sick, and I could not bear to gaze longer on these trivial
      pictures, on this vulgar show.... Yes, I felt dreary, worse than dreary.
      Even pity I felt nothing of for my brother men: all feelings in me were
      merged in one which I scarcely dare to name: a feeling of loathing, and
      stronger than all and more than all within me was the loathing&mdash;for
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cease,&rsquo; whispered Alice, &lsquo;cease, or I cannot carry you. You have grown
      heavy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Home,&rsquo; I answered her in the very tone in which I used to say the word to
      my coachman, when I came out at four o&rsquo;clock at night from some Moscow
      friends&rsquo;, where I had been talking since dinner-time of the future of
      Russia and the significance of the commune. &lsquo;Home,&rsquo; I repeated, and closed
      my eyes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXIV
    </h3>
    <p>
      But I soon opened them again. Alice seemed huddling strangely up to me;
      she was almost pushing against me. I looked at her and my blood froze at
      the sight. One who has chanced to behold on the face of another a sudden
      look of intense terror, the cause of which he does not suspect, will
      understand me. By terror, overmastering terror, the pale features of Alice
      were drawn and contorted, almost effaced. I had never seen anything like
      it even on a living human face. A lifeless, misty phantom, a shade,... and
      this deadly horror....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice, what is it?&rsquo; I said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She ... she ...&rsquo; she answered with an effort. &lsquo;She.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She? Who is she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not utter her name, not her name,&rsquo; Alice faltered hurriedly. &lsquo;We must
      escape, or there will be an end to everything, and for ever.... Look, over
      there!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned my head in the direction in which her trembling hand was
      pointing, and discerned something ... something horrible indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This something was the more horrible that it had no definite shape.
      Something bulky, dark, yellowish-black, spotted like a lizard&rsquo;s belly, not
      a storm-cloud, and not smoke, was crawling with a snake-like motion over
      the earth. A wide rhythmic undulating movement from above downwards, and
      from below upwards, an undulation recalling the malignant sweep of the
      wings of a vulture seeking its prey; at times an indescribably revolting
      grovelling on the earth, as of a spider stooping over its captured fly....
      Who are you, what are you, menacing mass? Under her influence, I saw it, I
      felt it&mdash;all sank into nothingness, all was dumb.... A putrefying,
      pestilential chill came from it. At this chill breath the heart turned
      sick, and the eyes grew dim, and the hair stood up on the head. It was a
      power moving; that power which there is no resisting, to which all is
      subject, which, sightless, shapeless, senseless, sees all, knows all, and
      like a bird of prey picks out its victims, like a snake, stifles them and
      stabs them with its frozen sting....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice! Alice!&rsquo; I shrieked like one in frenzy. &lsquo;It is death! death
      itself!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wailing sound I had heard before broke from Alice&rsquo;s lips; this time it
      was more like a human wail of despair, and we flew. But our flight was
      strangely and alarmingly unsteady; Alice turned over in the air, fell,
      rushed from side to side like a partridge mortally wounded, or trying to
      attract a dog away from her young. And meanwhile in pursuit of us, parting
      from the indescribable mass of horror, rushed sort of long undulating
      tentacles, like outstretched arms, like talons.... Suddenly a huge shape,
      a muffled figure on a pale horse, sprang up and flew upwards into the very
      heavens.... Still more fearfully, still more desperately Alice struggled.
      &lsquo;She has seen! All is over! I am lost!&rsquo; I heard her broken whisper. &lsquo;Oh, I
      am miserable! I might have profited, have won life,... and now....
      Nothingness, nothingness!&rsquo; It was too unbearable.... I lost consciousness.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XXV
    </h3>
    <p>
      When I came to myself, I was lying on my back in the grass, feeling a dull
      ache all over me, as from a bad bruise. The dawn was beginning in the sky:
      I could clearly distinguish things. Not far off, alongside a birch copse,
      ran a road planted with willows: the country seemed familiar to me. I
      began to recollect what had happened to me, and shuddered all over
      directly my mind recalled the last, hideous apparition....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what was Alice afraid of?&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;Can she too be subject to that
      power? Is she not immortal? Can she too be in danger of annihilation,
      dissolution? How is it possible?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft moan sounded close by me. I turned my head. Two paces from me lay
      stretched out motionless a young woman in a white gown, with thick
      disordered tresses, with bare shoulders. One arm was thrown behind her
      head, the other had fallen on her bosom. Her eyes were closed, and on her
      tightly shut lips stood a fleck of crimson stain. Could it be Alice? But
      Alice was a phantom, and I was looking upon a living woman. I crept up to
      her, bent down....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alice, is it you?&rsquo; I cried. Suddenly, slowly quivering, the wide eyelids
      rose; dark piercing eyes were fastened upon me, and at the same instant
      lips too fastened upon me, warm, moist, smelling of blood ... soft arms
      twined tightly round my neck, a burning, full heart pressed convulsively
      to mine. &lsquo;Farewell, farewell for ever!&rsquo; the dying voice uttered
      distinctly, and everything vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up, staggering like a drunken man, and passing my hands several
      times over my face, looked carefully about me. I found myself near the
      high road, a mile and a half from my own place. The sun had just risen
      when I got home.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the following nights I awaited&mdash;and I confess not without alarm&mdash;the
      appearance of my phantom; but it did not visit me again. I even set off
      one day, in the dusk, to the old oak, but nothing took place there out of
      the common. I did not, however, overmuch regret the discontinuance of this
      strange acquaintance. I reflected much and long over this inexplicable,
      almost unintelligible phenomenon; and I am convinced that not only science
      cannot explain it, but that even in fairy tales and legends nothing like
      it is to be met with. What was Alice, after all? An apparition, a restless
      soul, an evil spirit, a sylphide, a vampire, or what? Sometimes it struck
      me again that Alice was a woman I had known at some time or other, and I
      made tremendous efforts to recall where I had seen her.... Yes, yes, I
      thought sometimes, directly, this minute, I shall remember.... In a flash
      everything had melted away again like a dream. Yes, I thought a great
      deal, and, as is always the way, came to no conclusion. The advice or
      opinion of others I could not bring myself to invite; fearing to be taken
      for a madman. I gave up all reflection upon it at last; to tell the truth,
      I had no time for it. For one thing, the emancipation had come along with
      the redistribution of property, etc.; and for another, my own health
      failed; I suffered with my chest, with sleeplessness, and a cough. I got
      thin all over. My face was yellow as a dead man&rsquo;s. The doctor declares I
      have too little blood, calls my illness by the Greek name, &lsquo;anæmia,&rsquo; and
      is sending me to Gastein. The arbitrator swears that without me there&rsquo;s no
      coming to an understanding with the peasants. Well, what&rsquo;s one to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is the meaning of the piercingly-pure, shrill notes, the notes of
      an harmonica, which I hear directly any one&rsquo;s death is spoken of before
      me? They keep growing louder, more penetrating.... And why do I shudder in
      such anguish at the mere thought of annihilation?

    </h3>
    <p>
      About the middle of the sixteenth century there were living in Ferrara (it
      was at that time flourishing under the sceptre of its magnificent
      archdukes, the patrons of the arts and poetry) two young men, named Fabio
      and Muzzio. They were of the same age, and of near kinship, and were
      scarcely ever apart; the warmest affection had united them from early
      childhood ... the similarity of their positions strengthened the bond.
      Both belonged to old families; both were rich, independent, and without
      family ties; tastes and inclinations were alike in both. Muzzio was
      devoted to music, Fabio to painting. They were looked upon with pride by
      the whole of Ferrara, as ornaments of the court, society, and town. In
      appearance, however, they were not alike, though both were distinguished
      by a graceful, youthful beauty. Fabio was taller, fair of face and flaxen
      of hair, and he had blue eyes. Muzzio, on the other hand, had a swarthy
      face and black hair, and in his dark brown eyes there was not the merry
      light, nor on his lips the genial smile of Fabio; his thick eyebrows
      overhung narrow eyelids, while Fabio&rsquo;s golden eyebrows formed delicate
      half-circles on his pure, smooth brow. In conversation, too, Muzzio was
      less animated. For all that, the two friends were both alike looked on
      with favour by ladies, as well they might be, being models of chivalrous
      courtliness and generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time there was living in Ferrara a girl named Valeria. She was
      considered one of the greatest beauties in the town, though it was very
      seldom possible to see her, as she led a retired life, and never went out
      except to church, and on great holidays for a walk. She lived with her
      mother, a widow of noble family, though of small fortune, who had no other
      children. In every one whom Valeria met she inspired a sensation of
      involuntary admiration, and an equally involuntary tenderness and respect,
      so modest was her mien, so little, it seemed, was she aware of all the
      power of her own charms. Some, it is true, found her a little pale; her
      eyes, almost always downcast, expressed a certain shyness, even timidity;
      her lips rarely smiled, and then only faintly; her voice scarcely any one
      had heard. But the rumour went that it was most beautiful, and that, shut
      up in her own room, in the early morning when everything still slumbered
      in the town, she loved to sing old songs to the sound of the lute, on
      which she used to play herself. In spite of her pallor, Valeria was
      blooming with health; and even old people, as they gazed on her, could not
      but think, &lsquo;Oh, how happy the youth for whom that pure maiden bud, still
      enfolded in its petals, will one day open into full flower!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      Fabio and Muzzio saw Valeria for the first time at a magnificent public
      festival, celebrated at the command of the Archduke of Ferrara, Ercol, son
      of the celebrated Lucrezia Borgia, in honour of some illustrious grandees
      who had come from Paris on the invitation of the Archduchess, daughter of
      the French king, Louis XII. Valeria was sitting beside her mother on an
      elegant tribune, built after a design of Palladio, in the principal square
      of Ferrara, for the most honourable ladies in the town. Both Fabio and
      Muzzio fell passionately in love with her on that day; and, as they never
      had any secrets from each other, each of them soon knew what was passing
      in his friend&rsquo;s heart. They agreed together that both should try to get to
      know Valeria; and if she should deign to choose one of them, the other
      should submit without a murmur to her decision. A few weeks later, thanks
      to the excellent renown they deservedly enjoyed, they succeeded in
      penetrating into the widow&rsquo;s house, difficult though it was to obtain an
      entry to it; she permitted them to visit her. From that time forward they
      were able almost every day to see Valeria and to converse with her; and
      every day the passion kindled in the hearts of both young men grew
      stronger and stronger. Valeria, however, showed no preference for either
      of them, though their society was obviously agreeable to her. With Muzzio,
      she occupied herself with music; but she talked more with Fabio, with him
      she was less timid. At last, they resolved to learn once for all their
      fate, and sent a letter to Valeria, in which they begged her to be open
      with them, and to say to which she would be ready to give her hand.
      Valeria showed this letter to her mother, and declared that she was
      willing to remain unmarried, but if her mother considered it time for her
      to enter upon matrimony, then she would marry whichever one her mother&rsquo;s
      choice should fix upon. The excellent widow shed a few tears at the
      thought of parting from her beloved child; there was, however, no good
      ground for refusing the suitors, she considered both of them equally
      worthy of her daughter&rsquo;s hand. But, as she secretly preferred Fabio, and
      suspected that Valeria liked him the better, she fixed upon him. The next
      day Fabio heard of his happy fate, while all that was left for Muzzio was
      to keep his word, and submit. And this he did; but to be the witness of
      the triumph of his friend and rival was more than he could do. He promptly
      sold the greater part of his property, and collecting some thousands of
      ducats, he set off on a far journey to the East. As he said farewell to
      Fabio, he told him that he should not return till he felt that the last
      traces of passion had vanished from his heart. It was painful to Fabio to
      part from the friend of his childhood and youth ... but the joyous
      anticipation of approaching bliss soon swallowed up all other sensations,
      and he gave himself up wholly to the transports of successful love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after, he celebrated his nuptials with Valeria, and only then
      learnt the full worth of the treasure it had been his fortune to obtain.
      He had a charming villa, shut in by a shady garden, a short distance from
      Ferrara; he moved thither with his wife and her mother. Then a time of
      happiness began for them. Married life brought out in a new and enchanting
      light all the perfections of Valeria. Fabio became an artist of
      distinction&mdash;no longer a mere amateur, but a real master. Valeria&rsquo;s
      mother rejoiced, and thanked God as she looked upon the happy pair. Four
      years flew by unperceived, like a delicious dream. One thing only was
      wanting to the young couple, one lack they mourned over as a sorrow: they
      had no children ... but they had not given up all hope of them. At the end
      of the fourth year they were overtaken by a great, this time a real
      sorrow; Valeria&rsquo;s mother died after an illness of a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many tears were shed by Valeria; for a long time she could not accustom
      herself to her loss. But another year went by; life again asserted its
      rights and flowed along its old channel. And behold, one fine summer
      evening, unexpected by every one, Muzzio returned to Ferrara.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      During the whole space of five years that had elapsed since his departure
      no one had heard anything of him; all talk about him had died away, as
      though he had vanished from the face of the earth. When Fabio met his
      friend in one of the streets of Ferrara he almost cried out aloud, first
      in alarm and then in delight, and he at once invited him to his villa.
      There happened to be in his garden there a spacious pavilion, apart from
      the house; he proposed to his friend that he should establish himself in
      this pavilion. Muzzio readily agreed and moved thither the same day
      together with his servant, a dumb Malay&mdash;dumb but not deaf, and
      indeed, to judge by the alertness of his expression, a very intelligent
      man.... His tongue had been cut out. Muzzio brought with him dozens of
      boxes, filled with treasures of all sorts collected by him in the course
      of his prolonged travels. Valeria was delighted at Muzzio&rsquo;s return; and he
      greeted her with cheerful friendliness, but composure; it could be seen in
      every action that he had kept the promise given to Fabio. During the day
      he completely arranged everything in order in his pavilion; aided by his
      Malay, he unpacked the curiosities he had brought; rugs, silken stuffs,
      velvet and brocaded garments, weapons, goblets, dishes and bowls,
      decorated with enamel, things made of gold and silver, and inlaid with
      pearl and turquoise, carved boxes of jasper and ivory, cut bottles,
      spices, incense, skins of wild beasts, and feathers of unknown birds, and
      a number of other things, the very use of which seemed mysterious and
      incomprehensible. Among all these precious things there was a rich pearl
      necklace, bestowed upon Muzzio by the king of Persia for some great and
      secret service; he asked permission of Valeria to put this necklace with
      his own hand about her neck; she was struck by its great weight and a sort
      of strange heat in it ... it seemed to burn to her skin. In the evening
      after dinner as they sat on the terrace of the villa in the shade of the
      oleanders and laurels, Muzzio began to relate his adventures. He told of
      the distant lands he had seen, of cloud-topped mountains and deserts,
      rivers like seas; he told of immense buildings and temples, of trees a
      thousand years old, of birds and flowers of the colours of the rainbow: he
      named the cities and the peoples he had visited ... their very names
      seemed like a fairy tale. The whole East was familiar to Muzzio; he had
      traversed Persia, Arabia, where the horses are nobler and more beautiful
      than any other living creatures; he had penetrated into the very heart of
      India, where the race of men grow like stately trees; he had reached the
      boundaries of China and Thibet, where the living god, called the Grand
      Llama, dwells on earth in the guise of a silent man with narrow eyes.
      Marvellous were his tales. Both Fabio and Valeria listened to him as if
      enchanted. Muzzio&rsquo;s features had really changed very little; his face,
      swarthy from childhood, had grown darker still, burnt under the rays of a
      hotter sun, his eyes seemed more deep-set than before&mdash;and that was
      all; but the expression of his face had become different: concentrated and
      dignified, it never showed more life when he recalled the dangers he had
      encountered by night in forests that resounded with the roar of tigers or
      by day on solitary ways where savage fanatics lay in wait for travellers,
      to slay them in honour of their iron goddess who demands human sacrifices.
      And Muzzio&rsquo;s voice had grown deeper and more even; his hands, his whole
      body had lost the freedom of gesture peculiar to the Italian race. With
      the aid of his servant, the obsequiously alert Malay, he showed his hosts
      a few of the feats he had learnt from the Indian Brahmins. Thus for
      instance, having first hidden himself behind a curtain, he suddenly
      appeared sitting in the air cross-legged, the tips of his fingers pressed
      lightly on a bamboo cane placed vertically, which astounded Fabio not a
      little and positively alarmed Valeria.... &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a sorcerer?&rsquo; was her
      thought. When he proceeded, piping on a little flute, to call some tame
      snakes out of a covered basket, where their dark flat heads with quivering
      tongues appeared under a parti-coloured cloth, Valeria was terrified and
      begged Muzzio to put away these loathsome horrors as soon as possible. At
      supper Muzzio regaled his friends with wine of Shiraz from a round
      long-necked flagon; it was of extraordinary fragrance and thickness, of a
      golden colour with a shade of green in it, and it shone with a strange
      brightness as it was poured into the tiny jasper goblets. In taste it was
      unlike European wines: it was very sweet and spicy, and, drunk slowly in
      small draughts, produced a sensation of pleasant drowsiness in all the
      limbs. Muzzio made both Fabio and Valeria drink a goblet of it, and he
      drank one himself. Bending over her goblet he murmured something, moving
      his fingers as he did so. Valeria noticed this; but as in all Muzzio&rsquo;s
      doings, in his whole behaviour, there was something strange and out of the
      common, she only thought; &lsquo;Can he have adopted some new faith in India, or
      is that the custom there?&rsquo; Then after a short silence she asked him: &lsquo;Had
      he persevered with music during his travels?&rsquo; Muzzio, in reply, bade the
      Malay bring his Indian violin. It was like those of to-day, but instead of
      four strings it had only three, the upper part of it was covered with a
      bluish snake-skin, and the slender bow of reed was in the form of a
      half-moon, and on its extreme end glittered a pointed diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muzzio played first some mournful airs, national songs as he told them,
      strange and even barbarous to an Italian ear; the sound of the metallic
      strings was plaintive and feeble. But when Muzzio began the last song, it
      suddenly gained force and rang out tunefully and powerfully; the
      passionate melody flowed out under the wide sweeps of the bow, flowed out,
      exquisitely twisting and coiling like the snake that covered the
      violin-top; and such fire, such triumphant bliss glowed and burned in this
      melody that Fabio and Valeria felt wrung to the heart and tears came into
      their eyes; ... while Muzzio, his head bent, and pressed close to the
      violin, his cheeks pale, his eyebrows drawn together into a single
      straight line, seemed still more concentrated and solemn; and the diamond
      at the end of the bow flashed sparks of light as though it too were
      kindled by the fire of the divine song. When Muzzio had finished, and
      still keeping fast the violin between his chin and his shoulder, dropped
      the hand that held the bow, &lsquo;What is that? What is that you have been
      playing to us?&rsquo; cried Fabio. Valeria uttered not a word&mdash;but her
      whole being seemed echoing her husband&rsquo;s question. Muzzio laid the violin
      on the table&mdash;and slightly tossing back his hair, he said with a
      polite smile: &lsquo;That&mdash;that melody ... that song I heard once in the
      island of Ceylon. That song is known there among the people as the song of
      happy, triumphant love.&rsquo; &lsquo;Play it again,&rsquo; Fabio was murmuring. &lsquo;No; it
      can&rsquo;t be played again,&rsquo; answered Muzzio. &lsquo;Besides, it is now too late.
      Signora Valeria ought to be at rest; and it&rsquo;s time for me too ... I am
      weary.&rsquo; During the whole day Muzzio had treated Valeria with respectful
      simplicity, as a friend of former days, but as he went out he clasped her
      hand very tightly, squeezing his fingers on her palm, and looking so
      intently into her face that though she did not raise her eyelids, she yet
      felt the look on her suddenly flaming cheeks. She said nothing to Muzzio,
      but jerked away her hand, and when he was gone, she gazed at the door
      through which he had passed out. She remembered how she had been a little
      afraid of him even in old days ... and now she was overcome by perplexity.
      Muzzio went off to his pavilion: the husband and wife went to their
      bedroom.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      Valeria did not quickly fall asleep; there was a faint and languid fever
      in her blood and a slight ringing in her ears ... from that strange wine,
      as she supposed, and perhaps too from Muzzio&rsquo;s stories, from his playing
      on the violin ... towards morning she did at last fall asleep, and she had
      an extraordinary dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dreamt that she was going into a large room with a low ceiling....
      Such a room she had never seen in her life. All the walls were covered
      with tiny blue tiles with gold lines on them; slender carved pillars of
      alabaster supported the marble ceiling; the ceiling itself and the pillars
      seemed half transparent ... a pale rosy light penetrated from all sides
      into the room, throwing a mysterious and uniform light on all the objects
      in it; brocaded cushions lay on a narrow rug in the very middle of the
      floor, which was smooth as a mirror. In the corners almost unseen were
      smoking lofty censers, of the shape of monstrous beasts; there was no
      window anywhere; a door hung with a velvet curtain stood dark and silent
      in a recess in the wall. And suddenly this curtain slowly glided, moved
      aside ... and in came Muzzio. He bowed, opened his arms, laughed.... His
      fierce arms enfolded Valeria&rsquo;s waist; his parched lips burned her all
      over.... She fell backwards on the cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Moaning with horror, after long struggles, Valeria awaked. Still not
      realising where she was and what was happening to her, she raised herself
      on her bed, looked round.... A tremor ran over her whole body ... Fabio
      was lying beside her. He was asleep; but his face in the light of the
      brilliant full moon looking in at the window was pale as a corpse&rsquo;s ... it
      was sadder than a dead face. Valeria waked her husband, and directly he
      looked at her. &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;I had&mdash;I had a
      fearful dream,&rsquo; she whispered, still shuddering all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that instant from the direction of the pavilion came floating
      powerful sounds, and both Fabio and Valeria recognised the melody Muzzio
      had played to them, calling it the song of blissful triumphant love. Fabio
      looked in perplexity at Valeria ... she closed her eyes, turned away, and
      both holding their breath, heard the song out to the end. As the last note
      died away, the moon passed behind a cloud, it was suddenly dark in the
      room.... Both the young people let their heads sink on their pillows
      without exchanging a word, and neither of them noticed when the other fell
      asleep.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next morning Muzzio came in to breakfast; he seemed happy and greeted
      Valeria cheerfully. She answered him in confusion&mdash;stole a glance at
      him&mdash;and felt frightened at the sight of that serene happy face,
      those piercing and inquisitive eyes. Muzzio was beginning again to tell
      some story ... but Fabio interrupted him at the first word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You could not sleep, I see, in your new quarters. My wife and I heard you
      playing last night&rsquo;s song.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes! Did you hear it?&rsquo; said Muzzio. &lsquo;I played it indeed; but I had been
      asleep before that, and I had a wonderful dream too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Valeria was on the alert. &lsquo;What sort of dream?&rsquo; asked Fabio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dreamed,&rsquo; answered Muzzio, not taking his eyes off Valeria, &lsquo;I was
      entering a spacious apartment with a ceiling decorated in Oriental
      fashion, carved columns supported the roof, the walls were covered with
      tiles, and though there were neither windows nor lights, the whole room
      was filled with a rosy light, just as though it were all built of
      transparent stone. In the corners, Chinese censers were smoking, on the
      floor lay brocaded cushions along a narrow rug. I went in through a door
      covered with a curtain, and at another door just opposite appeared a woman
      whom I once loved. And so beautiful she seemed to me, that I was all
      aflame with my old love....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Muzzio broke off significantly. Valeria sat motionless, and only gradually
      she turned white ... and she drew her breath more slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; continued Muzzio, &lsquo;I waked up and played that song.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But who was that woman?&rsquo; said Fabio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who was she? The wife of an Indian&mdash;I met her in the town of
      Delhi.... She is not alive now&mdash;she died.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And her husband?&rsquo; asked Fabio, not knowing why he asked the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her husband, too, they say is dead. I soon lost sight of them both.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Strange!&rsquo; observed Fabio. &lsquo;My wife too had an extraordinary dream last
      night&rsquo;&mdash;Muzzio gazed intently at Valeria&mdash;&lsquo;which she did not
      tell me,&rsquo; added Fabio.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this point Valeria got up and went out of the room. Immediately
      after breakfast, Muzzio too went away, explaining that he had to be in
      Ferrara on business, and that he would not be back before the evening.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI
    </h3>
    <p>
      A few weeks before Muzzio&rsquo;s return, Fabio had begun a portrait of his
      wife, depicting her with the attributes of Saint Cecilia. He had made
      considerable advance in his art; the renowned Luini, a pupil of Leonardo
      da Vinci, used to come to him at Ferrara, and while aiding him with his
      own counsels, pass on also the precepts of his great master. The portrait
      was almost completely finished; all that was left was to add a few strokes
      to the face, and Fabio might well be proud of his creation. After seeing
      Muzzio off on his way to Ferrara, he turned into his studio, where Valeria
      was usually waiting for him; but he did not find her there; he called her,
      she did not respond. Fabio was overcome by a secret uneasiness; he began
      looking for her. She was nowhere in the house; Fabio ran into the garden,
      and there in one of the more secluded walks he caught sight of Valeria.
      She was sitting on a seat, her head drooping on to her bosom and her hands
      folded upon her knees; while behind her, peeping out of the dark green of
      a cypress, a marble satyr, with a distorted malignant grin on his face,
      was putting his pouting lips to a Pan&rsquo;s pipe. Valeria was visibly relieved
      at her husband&rsquo;s appearance, and to his agitated questions she replied
      that she had a slight headache, but that it was of no consequence, and she
      was ready to come to sit to him. Fabio led her to the studio, posed her,
      and took up his brush; but to his great vexation, he could not finish the
      face as he would have liked to. And not because it was somewhat pale and
      looked exhausted ... no; but the pure, saintly expression, which he liked
      so much in it, and which had given him the idea of painting Valeria as
      Saint Cecilia, he could not find in it that day. He flung down the brush
      at last, told his wife he was not in the mood for work, and that he would
      not prevent her from lying down, as she did not look at all well, and put
      the canvas with its face to the wall. Valeria agreed with him that she
      ought to rest, and repeating her complaints of a headache, withdrew into
      her bedroom. Fabio remained in the studio. He felt a strange confused
      sensation incomprehensible to himself. Muzzio&rsquo;s stay under his roof, to
      which he, Fabio, had himself urgently invited him, was irksome to him. And
      not that he was jealous&mdash;could any one have been jealous of Valeria!&mdash;but
      he did not recognise his former comrade in his friend. All that was
      strange, unknown and new that Muzzio had brought with him from those
      distant lands&mdash;and which seemed to have entered into his very flesh
      and blood&mdash;all these magical feats, songs, strange drinks, this dumb
      Malay, even the spicy fragrance diffused by Muzzio&rsquo;s garments, his hair,
      his breath&mdash;all this inspired in Fabio a sensation akin to distrust,
      possibly even to timidity. And why did that Malay waiting at table stare
      with such disagreeable intentness at him, Fabio? Really any one might
      suppose that he understood Italian. Muzzio had said of him that in losing
      his tongue, this Malay had made a great sacrifice, and in return he was
      now possessed of great power. What sort of power? and how could he have
      obtained it at the price of his tongue? All this was very strange! very
      incomprehensible! Fabio went into his wife&rsquo;s room; she was lying on the
      bed, dressed, but was not asleep. Hearing his steps, she started, then
      again seemed delighted to see him just as in the garden. Fabio sat down
      beside the bed, took Valeria by the hand, and after a short silence, asked
      her, &lsquo;What was the extraordinary dream that had frightened her so the
      previous night? And was it the same sort at all as the dream Muzzio had
      described?&rsquo; Valeria crimsoned and said hurriedly: &lsquo;O! no! no! I saw ... a
      sort of monster which was trying to tear me to pieces.&rsquo; &lsquo;A monster? in the
      shape of a man?&rsquo; asked Fabio. &lsquo;No, a beast ... a beast!&rsquo; Valeria turned
      away and hid her burning face in the pillows. Fabio held his wife&rsquo;s hand
      some time longer; silently he raised it to his lips, and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the young people passed that day with heavy hearts. Something dark
      seemed hanging over their heads ... but what it was, they could not tell.
      They wanted to be together, as though some danger threatened them; but
      what to say to one another they did not know. Fabio made an effort to take
      up the portrait, and to read Ariosto, whose poem had appeared not long
      before in Ferrara, and was now making a noise all over Italy; but nothing
      was of any use.... Late in the evening, just at supper-time, Muzzio
      returned.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      He seemed composed and cheerful&mdash;but he told them little; he devoted
      himself rather to questioning Fabio about their common acquaintances,
      about the German war, and the Emperor Charles: he spoke of his own desire
      to visit Rome, to see the new Pope. He again offered Valeria some Shiraz
      wine, and on her refusal, observed as though to himself, &lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s not
      needed, to be sure.&rsquo; Going back with his wife to their room, Fabio soon
      fell asleep; and waking up an hour later, felt a conviction that no one
      was sharing his bed; Valeria was not beside him. He got up quickly and at
      the same instant saw his wife in her night attire coming out of the garden
      into the room. The moon was shining brightly, though not long before a
      light rain had been falling. With eyes closed, with an expression of
      mysterious horror on her immovable face, Valeria approached the bed, and
      feeling for it with her hands stretched out before her, lay down hurriedly
      and in silence. Fabio turned to her with a question, but she made no
      reply; she seemed to be asleep. He touched her, and felt on her dress and
      on her hair drops of rain, and on the soles of her bare feet, little
      grains of sand. Then he leapt up and ran into the garden through the
      half-open door. The crude brilliance of the moon wrapt every object in
      light. Fabio looked about him, and perceived on the sand of the path
      prints of two pairs of feet&mdash;one pair were bare; and these prints led
      to a bower of jasmine, on one side, between the pavilion and the house. He
      stood still in perplexity, and suddenly once more he heard the strains of
      the song he had listened to the night before. Fabio shuddered, ran into
      the pavilion.... Muzzio was standing in the middle of the room playing on
      the violin. Fabio rushed up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been in the garden, your clothes are wet with rain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No ... I don&rsquo;t know ... I think ... I have not been out ...&rsquo; Muzzio
      answered slowly, seeming amazed at Fabio&rsquo;s entrance and his excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabio seized him by the hand. &lsquo;And why are you playing that melody again?
      Have you had a dream again?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Muzzio glanced at Fabio with the same look of amazement, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Answer me!&rsquo;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;The moon stood high like a round shield ...
  Like a snake, the river shines ...,
  The friend&rsquo;s awake, the foe&rsquo;s asleep ...
  The bird is in the falcon&rsquo;s clutches.... Help!&rdquo;&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      muttered Muzzio, humming to himself as though in delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabio stepped back two paces, stared at Muzzio, pondered a moment ... and
      went back to the house, to his bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valeria, her head sunk on her shoulder and her hands hanging lifelessly,
      was in a heavy sleep. He could not quickly awaken her ... but directly she
      saw him, she flung herself on his neck, and embraced him convulsively; she
      was trembling all over. &lsquo;What is the matter, my precious, what is it?&rsquo;
      Fabio kept repeating, trying to soothe her. But she still lay lifeless on
      his breast. &lsquo;Ah, what fearful dreams I have!&rsquo; she whispered, hiding her
      face against him. Fabio would have questioned her ... but she only
      shuddered. The window-panes were flushed with the early light of morning
      when at last she fell asleep in his arms.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next day Muzzio disappeared from early morning, while Valeria informed
      her husband that she intended to go away to a neighbouring monastery,
      where lived her spiritual father, an old and austere monk, in whom she
      placed unbounded confidence. To Fabio&rsquo;s inquiries she replied, that she
      wanted by confession to relieve her soul, which was weighed down by the
      exceptional impressions of the last few days. As he looked upon Valeria&rsquo;s
      sunken face, and listened to her faint voice, Fabio approved of her plan;
      the worthy Father Lorenzo might give her valuable advice, and might
      disperse her doubts.... Under the escort of four attendants, Valeria set
      off to the monastery, while Fabio remained at home, and wandered about the
      garden till his wife&rsquo;s return, trying to comprehend what had happened to
      her, and a victim to constant fear and wrath, and the pain of undefined
      suspicions.... More than once he went up to the pavilion; but Muzzio had
      not returned, and the Malay gazed at Fabio like a statue, obsequiously
      bowing his head, with a well-dissembled&mdash;so at least it seemed to
      Fabio&mdash;smile on his bronzed face. Meanwhile, Valeria had in
      confession told everything to her priest, not so much with shame as with
      horror. The priest heard her attentively, gave her his blessing, absolved
      her from her involuntary sin, but to himself he thought: &lsquo;Sorcery, the
      arts of the devil ... the matter can&rsquo;t be left so,&rsquo; ... and he returned
      with Valeria to her villa, as though with the aim of completely pacifying
      and reassuring her. At the sight of the priest Fabio was thrown into some
      agitation; but the experienced old man had thought out beforehand how he
      must treat him. When he was left alone with Fabio, he did not of course
      betray the secrets of the confessional, but he advised him if possible to
      get rid of the guest they had invited to their house, as by his stories,
      his songs, and his whole behaviour he was troubling the imagination of
      Valeria. Moreover, in the old man&rsquo;s opinion, Muzzio had not, he
      remembered, been very firm in the faith in former days, and having spent
      so long a time in lands unenlightened by the truths of Christianity, he
      might well have brought thence the contagion of false doctrine, might even
      have become conversant with secret magic arts; and, therefore, though long
      friendship had indeed its claims, still a wise prudence pointed to the
      necessity of separation. Fabio fully agreed with the excellent monk.
      Valeria was even joyful when her husband reported to her the priest&rsquo;s
      counsel; and sent on his way with the cordial good-will of both the young
      people, loaded with good gifts for the monastery and the poor, Father
      Lorenzo returned home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabio intended to have an explanation with Muzzio immediately after
      supper; but his strange guest did not return to supper. Then Fabio decided
      to defer his conversation with Muzzio until the following day; and both
      the young people retired to rest.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IX
    </h3>
    <p>
      Valeria soon fell asleep; but Fabio could not sleep. In the stillness of
      the night, everything he had seen, everything he had felt presented itself
      more vividly; he put to himself still more insistently questions to which
      as before he could find no answer. Had Muzzio really become a sorcerer,
      and had he not already poisoned Valeria? She was ill ... but what was her
      disease? While he lay, his head in his hand, holding his feverish breath,
      and given up to painful reflection, the moon rose again upon a cloudless
      sky; and together with its beams, through the half-transparent
      window-panes, there began, from the direction of the pavilion&mdash;or was
      it Fabio&rsquo;s fancy?&mdash;to come a breath, like a light, fragrant current
      ... then an urgent, passionate murmur was heard ... and at that instant he
      observed that Valeria was beginning faintly to stir. He started, looked;
      she rose up, slid first one foot, then the other out of the bed, and like
      one bewitched of the moon, her sightless eyes fixed lifelessly before her,
      her hands stretched out, she began moving towards the garden! Fabio
      instantly ran out of the other door of the room, and running quickly round
      the corner of the house, bolted the door that led into the garden.... He
      had scarcely time to grasp at the bolt, when he felt some one trying to
      open the door from the inside, pressing against it ... again and again ...
      and then there was the sound of piteous passionate moans....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Muzzio has not come back from the town,&rsquo; flashed through Fabio&rsquo;s
      head, and he rushed to the pavilion....
    </p>
    <p>
      What did he see?
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming towards him, along the path dazzlingly lighted up by the moon&rsquo;s
      rays, was Muzzio, he too moving like one moonstruck, his hands held out
      before him, and his eyes open but unseeing.... Fabio ran up to him, but
      he, not heeding him, moved on, treading evenly, step by step, and his
      rigid face smiled in the moonlight like the Malay&rsquo;s. Fabio would have
      called him by his name ... but at that instant he heard, behind him in the
      house, the creaking of a window.... He looked round....
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the window of the bedroom was open from top to bottom, and putting
      one foot over the sill, Valeria stood in the window ... her hands seemed
      to be seeking Muzzio ... she seemed striving all over towards him....
    </p>
    <p>
      Unutterable fury filled Fabio&rsquo;s breast with a sudden inrush. &lsquo;Accursed
      sorcerer!&rsquo; he shrieked furiously, and seizing Muzzio by the throat with
      one hand, with the other he felt for the dagger in his girdle, and plunged
      the blade into his side up to the hilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muzzio uttered a shrill scream, and clapping his hand to the wound, ran
      staggering back to the pavilion.... But at the very same instant when
      Fabio stabbed him, Valeria screamed just as shrilly, and fell to the earth
      like grass before the scythe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabio flew to her, raised her up, carried her to the bed, began to speak
      to her....
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay a long time motionless, but at last she opened her eyes, heaved a
      deep, broken, blissful sigh, like one just rescued from imminent death,
      saw her husband, and twining her arms about his neck, crept close to him.
      &lsquo;You, you, it is you,&rsquo; she faltered. Gradually her hands loosened their
      hold, her head sank back, and murmuring with a blissful smile, &lsquo;Thank God,
      it is all over.... But how weary I am!&rsquo; she fell into a sound but not
      heavy sleep.
    </p>
    <h3>
      X
    </h3>
    <p>
      Fabio sank down beside her bed, and never taking his eyes off her pale and
      sunken, but already calmer, face, began reflecting on what had happened
      ... and also on how he ought to act now. What steps was he to take? If he
      had killed Muzzio&mdash;and remembering how deeply the dagger had gone in,
      he could have no doubt of it&mdash;it could not be hidden. He would have
      to bring it to the knowledge of the archduke, of the judges ... but how
      explain, how describe such an incomprehensible affair? He, Fabio, had
      killed in his own house his own kinsman, his dearest friend? They will
      inquire, What for? on what ground?... But if Muzzio were not dead? Fabio
      could not endure to remain longer in uncertainty, and satisfying himself
      that Valeria was asleep, he cautiously got up from his chair, went out of
      the house, and made his way to the pavilion. Everything was still in it;
      only in one window a light was visible. With a sinking heart he opened the
      outer door (there was still the print of blood-stained fingers on it, and
      there were black drops of gore on the sand of the path), passed through
      the first dark room ... and stood still on the threshold, overwhelmed with
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the room, on a Persian rug, with a brocaded cushion under
      his head, and all his limbs stretched out straight, lay Muzzio, covered
      with a wide, red shawl with a black pattern on it. His face, yellow as
      wax, with closed eyes and bluish eyelids, was turned towards the ceiling,
      no breathing could be discerned: he seemed a corpse. At his feet knelt the
      Malay, also wrapt in a red shawl. He was holding in his left hand a branch
      of some unknown plant, like a fern, and bending slightly forward, was
      gazing fixedly at his master. A small torch fixed on the floor burnt with
      a greenish flame, and was the only light in the room. The flame did not
      flicker nor smoke. The Malay did not stir at Fabio&rsquo;s entry, he merely
      turned his eyes upon him, and again bent them upon Muzzio. From time to
      time he raised and lowered the branch, and waved it in the air, and his
      dumb lips slowly parted and moved as though uttering soundless words. On
      the floor between the Malay and Muzzio lay the dagger, with which Fabio
      had stabbed his friend; the Malay struck one blow with the branch on the
      blood-stained blade. A minute passed ... another. Fabio approached the
      Malay, and stooping down to him, asked in an undertone, &lsquo;Is he dead?&rsquo; The
      Malay bent his head from above downwards, and disentangling his right hand
      from his shawl, he pointed imperiously to the door. Fabio would have
      repeated his question, but the gesture of the commanding hand was
      repeated, and Fabio went out, indignant and wondering, but obedient.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Valeria sleeping as before, with an even more tranquil expression
      on her face. He did not undress, but seated himself by the window, his
      head in his hand, and once more sank into thought. The rising sun found
      him still in the same place. Valeria had not waked up.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XI
    </h3>
    <p>
      Fabio intended to wait till she awakened, and then to set off to Ferrara,
      when suddenly some one tapped lightly at the bedroom door. Fabio went out,
      and saw his old steward, Antonio. &lsquo;Signor,&rsquo; began the old man, &lsquo;the Malay
      has just informed me that Signor Muzzio has been taken ill, and wishes to
      be moved with all his belongings to the town; and that he begs you to let
      him have servants to assist in packing his things; and that at dinner-time
      you would send pack-horses, and saddle-horses, and a few attendants for
      the journey. Do you allow it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Malay informed you of this?&rsquo; asked Fabio. &lsquo;In what manner? Why, he is
      dumb.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, signor, is the paper on which he wrote all this in our language,
      and very correctly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Muzzio, you say, is ill?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, he is very ill, and can see no one.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Have they sent for a doctor?&rsquo; &lsquo;No. The Malay forbade it.&rsquo; &lsquo;And was it the
      Malay wrote you this?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, it was he.&rsquo; Fabio did not speak for a moment.
      &lsquo;Well, then, arrange it all,&rsquo; he said at last. Antonio withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabio looked after his servant in bewilderment. &lsquo;Then, he is not dead?&rsquo; he
      thought ... and he did not know whether to rejoice or to be sorry. &lsquo;Ill?&rsquo;
      But a few hours ago it was a corpse he had looked upon!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fabio returned to Valeria. She waked up and raised her head. The husband
      and wife exchanged a long look full of significance. &lsquo;He is gone?&rsquo; Valeria
      said suddenly. Fabio shuddered. &lsquo;How gone? Do you mean ...&rsquo; &lsquo;Is he gone
      away?&rsquo; she continued. A load fell from Fabio&rsquo;s heart. &lsquo;Not yet; but he is
      going to-day.&rsquo; &lsquo;And I shall never, never see him again?&rsquo; &lsquo;Never.&rsquo; &lsquo;And
      these dreams will not come again?&rsquo; &lsquo;No.&rsquo; Valeria again heaved a sigh of
      relief; a blissful smile once more appeared on her lips. She held out both
      hands to her husband. &lsquo;And we will never speak of him, never, do you hear,
      my dear one? And I will not leave my room till he is gone. And do you now
      send me my maids ... but stay: take away that thing!&rsquo; she pointed to the
      pearl necklace, lying on a little bedside table, the necklace given her by
      Muzzio, &lsquo;and throw it at once into our deepest well. Embrace me. I am your
      Valeria; and do not come in to me till ... he has gone.&rsquo; Fabio took the
      necklace&mdash;the pearls he fancied looked tarnished&mdash;and did as his
      wife had directed. Then he fell to wandering about the garden, looking
      from a distance at the pavilion, about which the bustle of preparations
      for departure was beginning. Servants were bringing out boxes, loading the
      horses ... but the Malay was not among them. An irresistible impulse drew
      Fabio to look once more upon what was taking place in the pavilion. He
      recollected that there was at the back a secret door, by which he could
      reach the inner room where Muzzio had been lying in the morning. He stole
      round to this door, found it unlocked, and, parting the folds of a heavy
      curtain, turned a faltering glance upon the room within.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Muzzio was not now lying on the rug. Dressed as though for a journey, he
      sat in an arm-chair, but seemed a corpse, just as on Fabio&rsquo;s first visit.
      His torpid head fell back on the chair, and his outstretched hands hung
      lifeless, yellow, and rigid on his knees. His breast did not heave. Near
      the chair on the floor, which was strewn with dried herbs, stood some flat
      bowls of dark liquid, which exhaled a powerful, almost suffocating, odour,
      the odour of musk. Around each bowl was coiled a small snake of brazen
      hue, with golden eyes that flashed from time to time; while directly
      facing Muzzio, two paces from him, rose the long figure of the Malay,
      wrapt in a mantle of many-coloured brocade, girt round the waist with a
      tiger&rsquo;s tail, with a high hat of the shape of a pointed tiara on his head.
      But he was not motionless: at one moment he bowed down reverently, and
      seemed to be praying, at the next he drew himself up to his full height,
      even rose on tiptoe; then, with a rhythmic action, threw wide his arms,
      and moved them persistently in the direction of Muzzio, and seemed to
      threaten or command him, frowning and stamping with his foot. All these
      actions seemed to cost him great effort, even to cause him pain: he
      breathed heavily, the sweat streamed down his face. All at once he sank
      down to the ground, and drawing in a full breath, with knitted brow and
      immense effort, drew his clenched hands towards him, as though he were
      holding reins in them ... and to the indescribable horror of Fabio,
      Muzzio&rsquo;s head slowly left the back of the chair, and moved forward,
      following the Malay&rsquo;s hands.... The Malay let them fall, and Muzzio&rsquo;s head
      fell heavily back again; the Malay repeated his movements, and obediently
      the head repeated them after him. The dark liquid in the bowls began
      boiling; the bowls themselves began to resound with a faint bell-like
      note, and the brazen snakes coiled freely about each of them. Then the
      Malay took a step forward, and raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes
      immensely wide, he bowed his head to Muzzio ... and the eyelids of the
      dead man quivered, parted uncertainly, and under them could be seen the
      eyeballs, dull as lead. The Malay&rsquo;s face was radiant with triumphant pride
      and delight, a delight almost malignant; he opened his mouth wide, and
      from the depths of his chest there broke out with effort a prolonged
      howl.... Muzzio&rsquo;s lips parted too, and a faint moan quivered on them in
      response to that inhuman sound.... But at this point Fabio could endure it
      no longer; he imagined he was present at some devilish incantation! He too
      uttered a shriek and rushed out, running home, home as quick as possible,
      without looking round, repeating prayers and crossing himself as he ran.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Three hours later, Antonio came to him with the announcement that
      everything was ready, the things were packed, and Signor Muzzio was
      preparing to start. Without a word in answer to his servant, Fabio went
      out on to the terrace, whence the pavilion could be seen. A few
      pack-horses were grouped before it; a powerful raven horse, saddled for
      two riders, was led up to the steps, where servants were standing
      bare-headed, together with armed attendants. The door of the pavilion
      opened, and supported by the Malay, who wore once more his ordinary
      attire, appeared Muzzio. His face was death-like, and his hands hung like
      a dead man&rsquo;s&mdash;but he walked ... yes, positively walked, and, seated
      on the charger, he sat upright and felt for and found the reins. The Malay
      put his feet in the stirrups, leaped up behind him on the saddle, put his
      arm round him, and the whole party started. The horses moved at a walking
      pace, and when they turned round before the house, Fabio fancied that in
      Muzzio&rsquo;s dark face there gleamed two spots of white.... Could it be he had
      turned his eyes upon him? Only the Malay bowed to him ... ironically, as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Valeria see all this? The blinds of her windows were drawn ... but it
      may be she was standing behind them.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIV
    </h3>
    <p>
      At dinner-time she came into the dining-room, and was very quiet and
      affectionate; she still complained, however, of weariness. But there was
      no agitation about her now, none of her former constant bewilderment and
      secret dread; and when, the day after Muzzio&rsquo;s departure, Fabio set to
      work again on her portrait, he found in her features the pure expression,
      the momentary eclipse of which had so troubled him ... and his brush moved
      lightly and faithfully over the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband and wife took up their old life again. Muzzio vanished for
      them as though he had never existed. Fabio and Valeria were agreed, as it
      seemed, not to utter a syllable referring to him, not to learn anything of
      his later days; his fate remained, however, a mystery for all. Muzzio did
      actually disappear, as though he had sunk into the earth. Fabio one day
      thought it his duty to tell Valeria exactly what had taken place on that
      fatal night ... but she probably divined his intention, and she held her
      breath, half-shutting her eyes, as though she were expecting a blow....
      And Fabio understood her; he did not inflict that blow upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine autumn day, Fabio was putting the last touches to his picture of
      his Cecilia; Valeria sat at the organ, her fingers straying at random over
      the keys.... Suddenly, without her knowing it, from under her hands came
      the first notes of that song of triumphant love which Muzzio had once
      played; and at the same instant, for the first time since her marriage,
      she felt within her the throb of a new palpitating life.... Valeria
      started, stopped....
    </p>
    <p>
      What did it mean? Could it be....

      THE DREAM
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      I was living at that time with my mother in a little seaside town. I was
      in my seventeenth year, while my mother was not quite five-and-thirty; she
      had married very young. When my father died, I was only seven years old,
      but I remember him well. My mother was a fair-haired woman, not very tall,
      with a charming, but always sad-looking face, a soft, tired voice and
      timid gestures. In her youth she had been reputed a beauty, and to the end
      she remained attractive and pretty. I have never seen deeper, tenderer,
      and sadder eyes, finer and softer hair; I never saw hands so exquisite. I
      adored her, and she loved me.... But our life was not a bright one; a
      secret, hopeless, undeserved sorrow seemed for ever gnawing at the very
      root of her being. This sorrow could not be accounted for by the loss of
      my father simply, great as that loss was to her, passionately as my mother
      had loved him, and devoutly as she had cherished his memory.... No!
      something more lay hidden in it, which I did not understand, but of which
      I was aware, dimly and yet intensely aware, whenever I looked into those
      soft and unchanging eyes, at those lips, unchanging too, not compressed in
      bitterness, but, as it were, for ever set in one expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that my mother loved me; but there were moments when she
      repulsed me, when my presence was oppressive to her, unendurable. At such
      times she felt a sort of involuntary aversion for me, and was horrified
      afterwards, blamed herself with tears, pressed me to her heart. I used to
      ascribe these momentary outbreaks of dislike to the derangement of her
      health, to her unhappiness.... These antagonistic feelings might indeed,
      to some extent, have been evoked by certain strange outbursts of wicked
      and criminal passions, which arose from time to time in me, though I could
      not myself account for them....
    </p>
    <p>
      But these evil outbursts were never coincident with the moments of
      aversion. My mother always wore black, as though in mourning. We were in
      fairly good circumstances, but we hardly knew any one.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      My mother concentrated her every thought, her every care, upon me. Her
      life was wrapped up in my life. That sort of relation between parents and
      children is not always good for the children ... it is rather apt to be
      harmful to them. Besides, I was my mother&rsquo;s only son ... and only children
      generally grow up in a one-sided way. In bringing them up, the parents
      think as much of themselves as of them.... That&rsquo;s not the right way. I was
      neither spoiled nor made hard by it (one or the other is apt to be the
      fate of only children), but my nerves were unhinged for a time; moreover,
      I was rather delicate in health, taking after my mother, whom I was very
      like in face. I avoided the companionship of boys of my own age; I held
      aloof from people altogether; even with my mother I talked very little. I
      liked best reading, solitary walks, and dreaming, dreaming! What my dreams
      were about, it would be hard to say; sometimes, indeed, I seemed to stand
      at a half-open door, beyond which lay unknown mysteries, to stand and
      wait, half dead with emotion, and not to step over the threshold, but
      still pondering what lay beyond, still to wait till I turned faint ... or
      fell asleep. If there had been a vein of poetry in me, I should probably
      have taken to writing verses; if I had felt an inclination for religion, I
      should perhaps have gone into a monastery; but I had no tendency of the
      sort, and I went on dreaming and waiting.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have just mentioned that I used sometimes to fall asleep under the
      influence of vague dreams and reveries. I used to sleep a great deal at
      all times, and dreams played an important part in my life; I used to have
      dreams almost every night. I did not forget them, I attributed a
      significance to them, regarded them as fore-warnings, tried to divine
      their secret meaning; some of them were repeated from time to time, which
      always struck me as strange and marvellous. I was particularly perplexed
      by one dream. I dreamed I was going along a narrow, ill-paved street of an
      old-fashioned town, between stone houses of many stories, with pointed
      roofs. I was looking for my father, who was not dead, but, for some reason
      or other, hiding away from us, and living in one of these very houses. And
      so I entered a low, dark gateway, crossed a long courtyard, lumbered up
      with planks and beams, and made my way at last into a little room with two
      round windows. In the middle of the room stood my father in a
      dressing-gown, smoking a pipe. He was not in the least like my real
      father; he was tall and thin, with black hair, a hook nose, with sullen
      and piercing eyes; he looked about forty. He was displeased at my having
      found him; and I too was far from being delighted at our meeting, and
      stood still in perplexity. He turned a little away, began muttering
      something, and walking up and down with short steps.... Then he gradually
      got farther away, never ceasing his muttering, and continually looking
      back over his shoulder; the room grew larger and was lost in fog.... I
      felt all at once horrified at the idea that I was losing my father again,
      and rushed after him, but I could no longer see him, I could only hear his
      angry muttering, like a bear growling.... My heart sank with dread; I woke
      up and could not for a long while get to sleep again.... All the following
      day I pondered on this dream, and naturally could make nothing of it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      The month of June had come. The town in which I was living with my mother
      became exceptionally lively about that time. A number of ships were in the
      harbour, a number of new faces were to be seen in the streets. I liked at
      such times to wander along the sea front, by cafés and hotels, to stare at
      the widely differing figures of the sailors and other people, sitting
      under linen awnings, at small white tables, with pewter pots of beer
      before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I passed one day before a café, I caught sight of a man who at once
      riveted my whole attention. Dressed in a long black full coat, with a
      straw hat pulled right down over his eyes, he was sitting perfectly still,
      his arms folded across his chest. The straggling curls of his black hair
      fell almost down to his nose; his thin lips held tight the mouthpiece of a
      short pipe. This man struck me as so familiar, every feature of his
      swarthy yellow face were so unmistakably imprinted in my memory, that I
      could not help stopping short before him, I could not help asking myself,
      &lsquo;Who is that man? where have I seen him?&rsquo; Becoming aware, probably, of my
      intent stare, he raised his black, piercing eyes upon me.... I uttered an
      involuntary &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was the father I had been looking for, the father I had beheld in
      my dream!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no possibility of mistake&mdash;the resemblance was too
      striking. The very coat even, that wrapped his spare limbs in its long
      skirts, in hue and cut, recalled the dressing-gown in which my father had
      appeared in the dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I not asleep now?&rsquo; I wondered.... No.... It was daytime, about me
      crowds of people were bustling, the sun was shining brightly in the blue
      sky, and before me was no phantom, but a living man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to an empty table, asked for a pot of beer and a newspaper, and
      sat down not far off from this enigmatical being.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      Putting the sheet of newspaper on a level with my face, I continued my
      scrutiny of the stranger. He scarcely stirred at all, only from time to
      time raising his bowed head. He was obviously expecting some one. I gazed
      and gazed.... Sometimes I fancied I must have imagined it all, that there
      could be really no resemblance, that I had given way to a half-unconscious
      trick of the imagination ... but the stranger would suddenly turn round a
      little in his seat, or slightly raise his hand, and again I all but cried
      out, again I saw my &lsquo;dream-father&rsquo; before me! He at last noticed my
      uncalled-for attention, and glancing at first with surprise and then with
      annoyance in my direction, was on the point of getting up, and knocked
      down a small walking-stick he had stood against the table. I instantly
      jumped up, picked it up, and handed it to him. My heart was beating
      violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a constrained smile, thanked me, and as his face drew closer to my
      face, he lifted his eyebrows and opened his mouth a little as though
      struck by something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very polite, young man,&rsquo; he began all at once in a dry, incisive,
      nasal voice, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s something out of the common nowadays. Let me
      congratulate you; you must have been well brought up?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t remember precisely what answer I made; but a conversation soon
      sprang up between us. I learnt that he was a fellow-countryman, that he
      had not long returned from America, where he had spent many years, and was
      shortly going back there. He called himself Baron ... the name I could not
      make out distinctly. He, just like my &lsquo;dream-father,&rsquo; ended every remark
      with a sort of indistinct inward mutter. He desired to learn my
      surname.... On hearing it, he seemed again astonished; then he asked me if
      I had lived long in the town, and with whom I was living. I told him I was
      living with my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your father?&rsquo; &lsquo;My father died long ago.&rsquo; He inquired my mother&rsquo;s
      Christian name, and immediately gave an awkward laugh, but apologised,
      saying that he picked up some American ways, and was rather a queer fellow
      altogether. Then he was curious to know what was our address. I told him.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI
    </h3>
    <p>
      The excitement which had possessed me at the beginning of our conversation
      gradually calmed down; I felt our meeting rather strange and nothing more.
      I did not like the little smile with which the baron cross-examined me; I
      did not like the expression of his eyes when he, as it were, stuck them
      like pins into me.... There was something in them rapacious, patronising
      ... something unnerving. Those eyes I had not seen in the dream. A strange
      face was the baron&rsquo;s! Faded, fatigued, and, at the same time,
      young-looking&mdash;unpleasantly young-looking! My &lsquo;dream-father&rsquo; had not
      the deep scar either which ran slanting right across my new acquaintance&rsquo;s
      forehead, and which I had not noticed till I came closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had hardly told the baron the name of the street, and the number of the
      house in which we were living, when a tall negro, swathed up to the
      eyebrows in a cloak, came up to him from behind, and softly tapped him on
      the shoulder. The baron turned round, ejaculated, &lsquo;Aha! at last!&rsquo; and with
      a slight nod to me, went with the negro into the café. I was left under
      the awning; I meant to await the baron&rsquo;s return, not so much with the
      object of entering into conversation with him again (I really did not know
      what to talk about to him), as to verify once more my first impression.
      But half-an-hour passed, an hour passed.... The baron did not appear. I
      went into the café, passed through all the rooms, but could see nowhere
      the baron or the negro.... They must both have gone out by a back-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      My head ached a little, and to get a little fresh air, I walked along the
      seafront to a large park outside the town, which had been laid out two
      hundred years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      After strolling for a couple of hours in the shade of the immense oaks and
      plane-trees, I returned home.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our maid-servant rushed all excitement, to meet me, directly I appeared in
      the hall; I guessed at once from the expression of her face, that during
      my absence something had gone wrong in our house. And, in fact, I learnt
      that an hour before, a fearful shriek had suddenly been heard in my
      mother&rsquo;s bedroom, the maid running in had found her on the floor in a
      fainting fit, which had lasted several moments. My mother had at last
      regained consciousness, but had been obliged to lie down, and looked
      strange and scared; she had not uttered a word, had not answered
      inquiries, she had done nothing but look about her and shudder. The maid
      had sent the gardener for a doctor. The doctor came and prescribed
      soothing treatment; but my mother would say nothing even to him. The
      gardener maintained that, a few instants after the shriek was heard in my
      mother&rsquo;s room, he had seen a man, unknown to him, running through the
      bushes in the garden to the gate into the street. (We lived in a house of
      one story, with windows opening on to a rather large garden.) The gardener
      had not time to get a look at the man&rsquo;s face; but he was tall, and was
      wearing a low straw hat and long coat with full skirts ... &lsquo;The baron&rsquo;s
      costume!&rsquo; at once crossed my mind. The gardener could not overtake him;
      besides, he had been immediately called into the house and sent for the
      doctor. I went in to my mother; she was lying on the bed, whiter than the
      pillow on which her head was resting. Recognising me, she smiled faintly,
      and held out her hand to me. I sat down beside her, and began to question
      her; at first she said no to everything; at last she admitted, however,
      that she had seen something which had greatly terrified her. &lsquo;Did some one
      come in here?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she hurriedly replied&mdash;&lsquo;no one came in,
      it was my fancy ... an apparition....&rsquo; She ceased and hid her face in her
      hands. I was on the point of telling her, what I had learnt from the
      gardener, and incidentally describing my meeting with the baron ... but
      for some reason or other, the words died away on my lips. I ventured,
      however, to observe to my mother, that apparitions do not usually appear
      in the daytime.... &lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; she whispered, &lsquo;please; do not torture me now.
      You will know some time....&rsquo; She was silent again. Her hands were cold and
      her pulse beat fast and unevenly. I gave her some medicine and moved a
      little away so as not to disturb her. She did not get up the whole day.
      She lay perfectly still and quiet, and now and then heaving a deep sigh,
      and timorously opening her eyes. Every one in the house was at a loss what
      to think.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Towards night my mother became a little feverish, and she sent me away. I
      did not, however, go to my own room, but lay down in the next room on the
      sofa. Every quarter of an hour I got up, went on tiptoe to the door,
      listened.... Everything was still&mdash;but my mother hardly slept that
      night. When I went in to her early in the morning, her face looked hollow,
      her eyes shone with an unnatural brightness. In the course of the day she
      got a little better, but towards evening the feverishness increased again.
      Up till then she had been obstinately silent, but all of a sudden she
      began talking in a hurried broken voice. She was not wandering, there was
      a meaning in her words&mdash;but no sort of connection. Just upon
      midnight, she suddenly, with a convulsive movement raised herself in bed&mdash;I
      was sitting beside her&mdash;and in the same hurried voice, continually
      taking sips of water, from a glass beside her, feebly gesticulating with
      her hands, and never once looking at me, she began to tell her story....
      She would stop, make an effort to control herself and go on again.... It
      was all so strange, just as though she were doing it all in a dream, as
      though she herself were absent, and some one else were speaking by her
      lips, or forcing her to speak.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IX
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to what I am going to tell you,&rsquo; she began. &lsquo;You are not a little
      boy now; you ought to know all. I had a friend, a girl.... She married a
      man she loved with all her heart, and she was very happy with her husband.
      During the first year of their married life they went together to the
      capital to spend a few weeks there and enjoy themselves. They stayed at a
      good hotel, and went out a great deal to theatres and parties. My friend
      was very pretty&mdash;every one noticed her, young men paid her
      attentions,&mdash;but there was among them one ... an officer. He followed
      her about incessantly, and wherever she was, she always saw his cruel
      black eyes. He was not introduced to her, and never once spoke to her&mdash;only
      perpetually stared at her&mdash;so insolently and strangely. All the
      pleasures of the capital were poisoned by his presence. She began
      persuading her husband to hasten their departure&mdash;and they had
      already made all the preparations for the journey. One evening her husband
      went out to a club&mdash;he had been invited by the officers of the same
      regiment as that officer&mdash;to play cards.... She was for the very
      first time left alone. Her husband did not return for a long while. She
      dismissed her maid, and went to bed.... And suddenly she felt overcome by
      terror, so that she was quite cold and shivering. She fancied she heard a
      slight sound on the other side of the wall, like a dog scratching, and she
      began watching the wall. In the corner a lamp was burning; the room was
      all hung with tapestry.... Suddenly something stirred there, rose,
      opened.... And straight out of the wall a black, long figure came, that
      awful man with the cruel eyes! She tried to scream, but could not. She was
      utterly numb with terror. He went up to her rapidly, like some beast of
      prey, flung something on her head, something strong-smelling, heavy,
      white.... What happened then I don&rsquo;t remember I ... don&rsquo;t remember! It was
      like death, like a murder.... When at last that fearful darkness began to
      pass away&mdash;when I ... when my friend came to herself, there was no
      one in the room. Again, and for a long time, she had not the strength to
      scream, she screamed at last ... then again everything was confusion....
      Then she saw her husband by her side: he had been kept at the club till
      two o&rsquo;clock at night.... He looked scared and white. He began questioning
      her, but she told him nothing.... Then she swooned away again. I remember
      though when she was left alone in the room, she examined the place in the
      wall.... Under the tapestry hangings it turned out there was a secret
      door. And her betrothal ring had gone from off her hand. This ring was of
      an unusual pattern; seven little gold stars alternated on it with seven
      silver stars; it was an old family heirloom. Her husband asked her what
      had become of the ring; she could give him no answer. Her husband supposed
      she had dropped it somewhere, searched everywhere, but could not find it.
      He felt uneasy and distressed; he decided to go home as soon as possible
      and directly the doctor allowed it&mdash;they left the capital.... But
      imagine! On the very day of their departure they happened suddenly to meet
      a stretcher being carried along the street.... On the stretcher lay a man
      who had just been killed, with his head cut open; and imagine! the man was
      that fearful apparition of the night with the evil eyes.... He had been
      killed over some gambling dispute!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then my friend went away into the country ... became a mother for the
      first time ... and lived several years with her husband. He never knew
      anything; indeed, what could she have told him?&mdash;she knew nothing
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her former happiness had vanished. A gloom had come over their lives,
      and never again did that gloom pass out of it.... They had no other
      children, either before or after ... and that son....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother trembled all over and hid her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But say now,&rsquo; she went on with redoubled energy, &lsquo;was my friend to blame
      in any way? What had she to reproach herself with? She was punished, but
      had she not the right to declare before God Himself that the punishment
      that overtook her was unjust? Then why is it, that like a criminal,
      tortured by stings of conscience, why is it she is confronted with the
      past in such a fearful shape after so many years? Macbeth slew Bancho&mdash;so
      no wonder that he could be haunted ... but I....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But here my mother&rsquo;s words became so mixed and confused, that I ceased to
      follow her.... I no longer doubted that she was in delirium.
    </p>
    <h3>
      X
    </h3>
    <p>
      The agitating effect of my mother&rsquo;s recital on me&mdash;any one may easily
      conceive! I guessed from her first word that she was talking of herself,
      and not any friend of hers. Her slip of the tongue confirmed my
      conjecture. Then this really was my father, whom I was seeking in my
      dream, whom I had seen awake by daylight! He had not been killed, as my
      mother supposed, but only wounded. And he had come to see her, and had run
      away, alarmed by her alarm. I suddenly understood everything: the feeling
      of involuntary aversion for me, which arose at times in my mother, and her
      perpetual melancholy, and our secluded life.... I remember my head seemed
      going round, and I clutched it in both hands as though to hold it still.
      But one idea, as it were, nailed me down; I resolved I must, come what
      may, find that man again? What for? with what aim? I could not give myself
      a clear answer, but to find him ... find him&mdash;that had become a
      question of life and death for me! The next morning my mother, at last,
      grew calmer ... the fever left her ... she fell asleep. Confiding her to
      the care of the servants and people of the house, I set out on my quest.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      First of all I made my way, of course, to the café where I had met the
      baron; but no one in the café knew him or had even noticed him; he had
      been a chance customer there. The negro the people there had observed, his
      figure was so striking; but who he was, and where he was staying, no one
      knew. Leaving my address in any case at the café, I fell to wandering
      about the streets and sea front by the harbour, along the boulevards,
      peeped into all places of public resort, but could find no one like the
      baron or his companion!... Not having caught the baron&rsquo;s surname, I was
      deprived of the resource of applying to the police; I did, however,
      privately let two or three guardians of the public safety know&mdash;they
      stared at me in bewilderment, and did not altogether believe in me&mdash;that
      I would reward them liberally if they could trace out two persons, whose
      exterior I tried to describe as exactly as possible. After wandering about
      in this way till dinner-time, I returned home exhausted. My mother had got
      up; but to her usual melancholy there was added something new, a sort of
      dreamy blankness, which cut me to the heart like a knife. I spent the
      evening with her. We scarcely spoke at all; she played patience, I looked
      at her cards in silence. She never made a single reference to what she had
      told me, nor to what had happened the preceding evening. It was as though
      we had made a secret compact not to touch on any of these harrowing and
      strange incidents.... She seemed angry with herself, and ashamed of what
      had broken from her unawares; though possibly she did not remember quite
      what she had said in her half delirious feverishness, and hoped I should
      spare her.... And indeed this was it, I spared her, and she felt it; as on
      the previous day she avoided my eyes. I could not get to sleep all night.
      Outside, a fearful storm suddenly came on. The wind howled and darted
      furiously hither and thither, the window-panes rattled and rang,
      despairing shrieks and groans sounded in the air, as though something had
      been torn to shreds up aloft, and were flying with frenzied wailing over
      the shaken houses. Before dawn I dropped off into a doze ... suddenly I
      fancied some one came into my room, and called me, uttered my name, in a
      voice not loud, but resolute. I raised my head and saw no one; but,
      strange to say! I was not only not afraid&mdash;I was glad; I suddenly
      felt a conviction that now I should certainly attain my object. I dressed
      hurriedly and went out of the house.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XII
    </h3>
    <p>
      The storm had abated ... but its last struggles could still be felt. It
      was very early, there were no people in the streets, many places were
      strewn with broken chimney-pots and tiles, pieces of wrecked fencing, and
      branches of trees.... &lsquo;What was it like last night at sea?&rsquo; I could not
      help wondering at the sight of the traces left by the storm. I intended to
      go to the harbour, but my legs, as though in obedience to some
      irresistible attraction, carried me in another direction. Ten minutes had
      not gone by before I found myself in a part of the town I had never
      visited till then. I walked not rapidly, but without halting, step by
      step, with a strange sensation at my heart; I expected something
      extraordinary, impossible, and at the same time I was convinced that this
      extraordinary thing would come to pass.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      And, behold, it came to pass, this extraordinary, this unexpected thing!
      Suddenly, twenty paces before me, I saw the very negro who had addressed
      the baron in the café! Muffled in the same cloak as I had noticed on him
      there, he seemed to spring out of the earth, and with his back turned to
      me, walked with rapid strides along the narrow pavement of the winding
      street. I promptly flew to overtake him, but he, too, redoubled his pace,
      though he did not look round, and all of a sudden turned sharply round the
      corner of a projecting house. I ran up to this corner, turned round it as
      quickly as the negro.... Wonderful to relate! I faced a long, narrow,
      perfectly empty street; the fog of early morning rilled it with its leaden
      dulness, but my eye reached to its very end, I could scan all the
      buildings in it ... and not a living creature stirring anywhere! The tall
      negro in the cloak had vanished as suddenly as he had appeared! I was
      bewildered ... but only for one instant. Another feeling at once took
      possession of me; the street, which stretched its length, dumb, and, as it
      were, dead, before my eyes, I knew it! It was the street of my dream. I
      started, shivered, the morning was so fresh, and promptly, without the
      least hesitation, with a sort of shudder of conviction, went on!
    </p>
    <p>
      I began looking about.... Yes, here it was; here to the right, standing
      cornerwise to the street, was the house of my dream, here too the
      old-fashioned gateway with scrollwork in stone on both sides.... It is
      true the windows of the house were not round, but rectangular ... but that
      was not important.... I knocked at the gate, knocked twice or three times,
      louder and louder.... The gate was opened slowly with a heavy groan as
      though yawning. I was confronted by a young servant girl with dishevelled
      hair, and sleepy eyes. She was apparently only just awake. &lsquo;Does the baron
      live here?&rsquo; I asked, and took in with a rapid glance the deep narrow
      courtyard.... Yes; it was all there ... there were the planks and beams I
      had seen in my dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; the servant girl answered, &lsquo;the baron&rsquo;s not living here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not? impossible!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not here now. He left yesterday.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s he gone?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To America.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To America!&rsquo; I repealed involuntarily. &lsquo;But he will come back?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant looked at me suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t know about that. May be he won&rsquo;t come back at all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And has he been living here long?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not long, a week. He&rsquo;s not here now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what was his surname, the baron&rsquo;s?&rsquo; The girl stared at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know his name? We simply called him the baron.&mdash;Hi!
      Piotr!&rsquo; she shouted, seeing I was pushing in. &lsquo;Come here; here&rsquo;s a
      stranger keeps asking questions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From the house came the clumsy figure of a sturdy workman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it? What do you want?&rsquo; he asked in a sleepy voice; and having
      heard me sullenly, he repeated what the girl had told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But who does live here?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our master.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A carpenter. They&rsquo;re all carpenters in this street.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can I see him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t now, he&rsquo;s asleep.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But can&rsquo;t I go into the house?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. Go away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but can I see your master later on?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for? Of course. You can always see him.... To be sure, he&rsquo;s always
      at his business here. Only go away now. Such a time in the morning, upon
      my soul!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but that negro?&rsquo; I asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The workman looked in perplexity first at me, then at the servant girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What negro?&rsquo; he said at last. &lsquo;Go away, sir. You can come later. You can
      talk to the master.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I went out into the street. The gate slammed at once behind me, sharply
      and heavily, with no groan this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I carefully noted the street and the house, and went away, but not home&mdash;I
      was conscious of a sort of disillusionment. Everything that had happened
      to me was so strange, so unexpected, and meanwhile what a stupid
      conclusion to it! I had been persuaded, I had been convinced, that I
      should see in that house the room I knew, and in the middle of it my
      father, the baron, in the dressing-gown, and with a pipe.... And instead
      of that, the master of the house was a carpenter, and I could go and see
      him as much as I liked&mdash;and order furniture of him, I dare say.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father had gone to America. And what was left for me to do?... To tell
      my mother everything, or to bury for ever the very memory of that meeting?
      I positively could not resign myself to the idea that such a supernatural,
      mysterious beginning should end in such a senseless, ordinary conclusion!
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not want to return home, and walked at random away from the town.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIV
    </h3>
    <p>
      I walked with downcast head, without thought, almost without sensation,
      but utterly buried in myself. A rhythmic hollow and angry noise raised me
      from my numbness. I lifted my head; it was the sea roaring and moaning
      fifty paces from me. I saw I was walking along the sand of the dunes. The
      sea, set in violent commotion by the storm in the night, was white with
      foam to the very horizon, and the sharp crests of the long billows rolled
      one after another and broke on the flat shore. I went nearer to it, and
      walked along the line left by the ebb and flow of the tides on the yellow
      furrowed sand, strewn with fragments of trailing seaweed, broken shells,
      and snakelike ribbons of sea-grass. Gulls, with pointed wings, flying with
      a plaintive cry on the wind out of the remote depths of the air, soared
      up, white as snow against the grey cloudy sky, fell abruptly, and seeming
      to leap from wave to wave, vanished again, and were lost like gleams of
      silver in the streaks of frothing foam. Several of them, I noticed,
      hovered persistently over a big rock, which stood up alone in the midst of
      the level uniformity of the sandy shore. Coarse seaweed was growing in
      irregular masses on one side of the rock; and where its matted tangles
      rose above the yellow line, was something black, something longish,
      curved, not very large.... I looked attentively.... Some dark object was
      lying there, lying motionless beside the rock.... This object grew
      clearer, more defined the nearer I got to it....
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only a distance of thirty paces left between me and the rock....
      Why, it was the outline of a human form! It was a corpse; it was a drowned
      man thrown up by the sea! I went right up to the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corpse was the baron, my father! I stood as though turned to stone.
      Only then I realised that I had been led since early morning by some
      unknown forces, that I was in their power, and for some instants there was
      nothing in my soul but the never-ceasing crash of the sea, and dumb horror
      at the fate that had possession of me....
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      He lay on his back, turned a little to one side, with his left arm behind
      his head ... the right was thrust under his bent body. The toes of his
      feet, in high sailor&rsquo;s boots, had been sucked into the slimy sea-mud; the
      short blue jacket, drenched through with brine, was still closely
      buttoned; a red scarf was fastened in a tight knot about his neck. The
      dark face, turned to the sky, looked as if it were laughing; the small
      close-set teeth could be seen under the lifted upper lip; the dim pupils
      of the half-closed eyes were scarcely discernible in the darkened
      eyeballs; the clotted hair, covered with bubbles of foam, lay dishevelled
      on the ground, and bared the smooth brow with the purple line of the scar;
      the narrow nose rose, a sharp white line, between the sunken cheeks. The
      storm of the previous night had done its work.... He would never see
      America again! The man who had outraged my mother, who had spoiled and
      soiled her life; my father&mdash;yes! my father&mdash;of that I could feel
      no doubt&mdash;lay helplessly outstretched in the mud at my feet. I
      experienced a sensation of satisfied revenge, and of pity, and repulsion,
      and horror, more than all ... a double horror, at what I saw, and at what
      had happened. The wicked criminal feelings of which I have spoken, those
      uncomprehended impulses of rage rose up in me ... choked me. &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; I
      thought, &lsquo;so that is why I am like this ... that is how my blood shows
      itself!&rsquo; I stood beside the corpse, and stared in suspense. Would not
      those dead eyes move, would not those stiff lips quiver? No! all was
      still; the very seaweed seemed lifeless where the breakers had flung it;
      even the gulls had flown; not a broken spar anywhere, not a fragment of
      wood, nor a bit of rigging. On all sides emptiness ... only he and I, and
      in the distance the sounding sea. I looked back; the same emptiness there:
      a ridge of lifeless downs on the horizon ... that was all! My heart
      revolted against leaving this luckless wretch in this solitude, on the
      briny sand of the seashore, to be devoured by fishes and birds; an inner
      voice told me I ought to find people, call them, if not to help&mdash;what
      help could there be now!&mdash;at least to lift him up, to carry him into
      some living habitation ... but an indescribable panic suddenly seized on
      me. It seemed to me that this dead man knew I had come here, that he had
      himself planned this last meeting. I even fancied I heard the indistinct
      mutter I knew so well.... I ran away ... looked back once.... Something
      glittering caught my eye; it brought me to a halt. It was a hoop of gold
      on the hand of the corpse.... I knew it for my mother&rsquo;s betrothal ring. I
      remember how I forced myself to turn back, to go up, to bend down ... I
      remember the clammy touch of the chill fingers; I remember how I held my
      breath, and half-closed my eyes, and set my teeth, tearing off the
      obstinate ring....
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, it was off ... and I was running, running away at full speed,
      with something flying behind me, upon my heels, overtaking me.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVI
    </h3>
    <p>
      All I had felt and gone through was probably written on my face when I got
      home. My mother abruptly drew herself up directly I went into her room,
      and looked with such urgent inquiry at me, that, after an unsuccessful
      attempt to explain, I ended by holding out the ring to her in silence. She
      turned fearfully white, her eyes opened extraordinarily and looked dead,
      like <i>those</i> eyes; she uttered a faint cry, snatched the ring,
      reeled, fell on my breast, and fairly swooned away, her head falling back,
      and her blank wide-open eyes staring at me. I threw both my arms about
      her, and standing where I was, without moving, told her slowly, in a
      subdued voice, everything, without the slightest concealment: my dream,
      and the meeting, and everything, everything.... She heard me to the end
      without uttering a single word, only her bosom heaved more and more
      violently, and her eyes suddenly flashed and sank. Then she put the ring
      on her third finger, and, moving away a little, began getting her cape and
      hat. I asked her where she was going. She lifted eyes full of surprise
      upon me, and tried to answer, but her voice failed her. She shuddered
      several times, rubbed her hands, as though she were trying to warm them,
      and at last said, &lsquo;Let us go there at once.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where, mother?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where he is lying ... I want to see ... I want to know ... I will
      know....&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I endeavoured to persuade her not to go; but she almost fell into a
      nervous attack. I saw it was impossible to oppose her wish, and we set
      off.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVII
    </h3>
    <p>
      And now I was again walking along the sand; but this time not alone. I had
      my mother on my arm. The sea had ebbed away, had retreated farther still;
      it was calmer, but its roar, though fainter, was still menacing and
      malignant. There, at last, rose the solitary rock before us; there was the
      seaweed too. I looked intently, I tried to distinguish that curved object
      lying on the ground&mdash;but I saw nothing. We went closer; instinctively
      I slackened my pace. But where was the black still object? Only the
      tangles of seaweed rose black against the sand, which had dried up by now.
      We went right up to the rock.... There was no corpse to be seen; and only
      where it had been lying there was still a hollow place, and one could see
      where the arms and where the legs had lain.... The seaweed around looked
      as it were crushed, and prints were visible of one man&rsquo;s feet; they
      crossed the dune, then were lost, as they reached the heaped-up shingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother and I looked at each other, and were frightened at what we saw
      in each other&rsquo;s faces....
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely he had not got up of himself and gone away?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are sure you saw him dead?&rsquo; she asked in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could only nod in assent. Three hours had not passed since I had come
      upon the baron&rsquo;s corpse.... Some one had discovered and removed it. I must
      find out who had done it, and what had become of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But first I had to look after my mother.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      While she had been walking to the fatal spot she had been in a fever, but
      she controlled herself. The disappearance of the dead body came upon her
      as a final blow. She was struck dumb. I feared for her reason. With great
      difficulty I got her home. I made her lie down again on her bed, again I
      sent for the doctor, but as soon as my mother had recovered herself a
      little, she at one desired me to set off without delay to find out &lsquo;that
      man.&rsquo; I obeyed. But, in spite of every possible effort, I discovered
      nothing. I went several times to the police, visited several villages in
      the neighbourhood, put several advertisements in the papers, collected
      information in all directions, and all in vain! I received information,
      indeed, that the corpse of a drowned man had been picked up in one of the
      seaside villages near.... I at once hastened off there, but from all I
      could hear the body had no resemblance to the baron. I found out in what
      ship he had set sail for America; at first every one was positive that
      ship had gone down in the storm; but a few months later there were rumours
      that it had been seen riding at anchor in New York harbour. Not knowing
      what steps to take, I began seeking out the negro I had seen, offering him
      in the papers a considerable sum of money if he would call at our house.
      Some tall negro in a cloak did actually call on us in my absence.... But
      after questioning the maid, he abruptly departed, and never came back
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So all traces were lost of my ... my father; so he vanished into silence
      and darkness never to return. My mother and I never spoke of him; only one
      day, I remember, she expressed surprise that I had never told her before
      of my strange dream; and added, &lsquo;It must mean he really....&rsquo;, but did not
      utter all her thought. My mother was ill a long while, and even after her
      recovery our former close relations never returned. She was ill at ease
      with me to the day of her death.... Ill at ease was just what she was. And
      that is a trouble there is no cure for. Anything may be smoothed over,
      memories of even the most tragic domestic incidents gradually lose their
      strength and bitterness; but if once a sense of being ill at ease installs
      itself between two closely united persons, it can never be dislodged! I
      never again had the dream that had once so agitated me; I no longer &lsquo;look
      for&rsquo; my father; but sometimes I fancied&mdash;and even now I fancy&mdash;that
      I hear, as it were, distant wails, as it were, never silent, mournful
      plaints; they seem to sound somewhere behind a high wall, which cannot be
      crossed; they wring my heart, and I weep with closed eyes, and am never
      able to tell what it is, whether it is a living man moaning, or whether I
      am listening to the wild, long-drawn-out howl of the troubled sea. And
      then it passes again into the muttering of some beast, and I fall asleep
      with anguish and horror in my heart.

      The last day of July; for a thousand versts around, Russia, our native
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unbroken blue flooding the whole sky; a single cloudlet upon it, half
      floating, half fading away. Windlessness, warmth ... air like new milk!
    </p>
    <p>
      Larks are trilling; pouter-pigeons cooing; noiselessly the swallows dart
      to and fro; horses are neighing and munching; the dogs do not bark and
      stand peaceably wagging their tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smell of smoke and of hay, and a little of tar, too, and a little of
      hides. The hemp, now in full bloom, sheds its heavy, pleasant fragrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep but sloping ravine. Along its sides willows in rows, with big heads
      above, trunks cleft below. Through the ravine runs a brook; the tiny
      pebbles at its bottom are all aquiver through its clear eddies. In the
      distance, on the border-line between earth and heaven, the bluish streak
      of a great river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the ravine, on one side, tidy barns, little storehouses with
      close-shut doors; on the other side, five or six pinewood huts with
      boarded roofs. Above each roof, the high pole of a pigeon-house; over each
      entry a little short-maned horse of wrought iron. The window-panes of
      faulty glass shine with all the colours of the rainbow. Jugs of flowers
      are painted on the shutters. Before each door, a little bench stands prim
      and neat; on the mounds of earth, cats are basking, their transparent ears
      pricked up alert; beyond the high door-sills, is the cool dark of the
      outer rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lie on the very edge of the ravine, on an outspread horse-cloth; all
      about are whole stacks of fresh-cut hay, oppressively fragrant. The
      sagacious husbandmen have flung the hay about before the huts; let it get
      a bit drier in the baking sunshine; and then into the barn with it. It
      will be first-rate sleeping on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curly, childish heads are sticking out of every haycock; crested hens are
      looking in the hay for flies and little beetles, and a white-lipped pup is
      rolling among the tangled stalks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flaxen-headed lads in clean smocks, belted low, in heavy boots, leaning
      over an unharnessed waggon, fling each other smart volleys of banter, with
      broad grins showing their white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A round-faced young woman peeps out of window; laughs at their words or at
      the romps of the children in the mounds of hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another young woman with powerful arms draws a great wet bucket out of the
      well.... The bucket quivers and shakes, spilling long, glistening drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before me stands an old woman in a new striped petticoat and new shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fat hollow beads are wound in three rows about her dark thin neck, her
      grey head is tied up in a yellow kerchief with red spots; it hangs low
      over her failing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is a smile of welcome in the aged eyes; a smile all over the
      wrinkled face. The old woman has reached, I dare say, her seventieth year
      ... and even now one can see she has been a beauty in her day.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a twirl of her sunburnt finger, she holds in her right hand a bowl of
      cold milk, with the cream on it, fresh from the cellar; the sides of the
      bowl are covered with drops, like strings of pearls. In the palm of her
      left hand the old woman brings me a huge hunch of warm bread, as though to
      say, &lsquo;Eat, and welcome, passing guest!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A cock suddenly crows and fussily flaps his wings; he is slowly answered
      by the low of a calf, shut up in the stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My word, what oats!&rsquo; I hear my coachman saying.... Oh, the content, the
      quiet, the plenty of the Russian open country! Oh, the deep peace and
      well-being!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the thought comes to me: what is it all to us here, the cross on the
      cupola of St. Sophia in Constantinople and all the rest that we are
      struggling for, we men of the town?

    <h2>
      A CONVERSATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neither the Jungfrau nor the Finsteraarhorn has yet been trodden by the
      foot of man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The topmost peaks of the Alps ... A whole chain of rugged precipices ...
      The very heart of the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the mountain, a pale green, clear, dumb sky. Bitter, cruel frost;
      hard, sparkling snow; sticking out of the snow, the sullen peaks of the
      ice-covered, wind-swept mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two massive forms, two giants on the sides of the horizon, the Jungfrau
      and the Finsteraarhorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Jungfrau speaks to its neighbour: &lsquo;What canst thou tell that is
      new? thou canst see more. What is there down below?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few thousand years go by: one minute. And the Finsteraarhorn roars back
      in answer: &lsquo;Thick clouds cover the earth.... Wait a little!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands more years go by: one minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and now?&rsquo; asks the Jungfrau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I see, there below all is the same. There are blue waters, black
      forests, grey heaps of piled-up stones. Among them are still fussing to
      and fro the insects, thou knowest, the bipeds that have never yet once
      defiled thee nor me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Men?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, men.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands of years go by: one minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and now?&rsquo; asks the Jungfrau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There seem fewer insects to be seen,&rsquo; thunders the Finsteraarhorn, &lsquo;it is
      clearer down below; the waters have shrunk, the forests are thinner.&rsquo;
      Again thousands of years go by: one minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What seeest thou?&rsquo; says the Jungfrau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Close about us it seems purer,&rsquo; answers the Finsteraarhorn, &lsquo;but there in
      the distance in the valleys are still spots, and something is moving.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;And now?&rsquo; asks the Jungfrau, after more thousands of years: one minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now it is well,&rsquo; answers the Finsteraarhorn, &lsquo;it is clean everywhere,
      quite white, wherever you look ... Everywhere is our snow, unbroken snow
      and ice. Everything is frozen. It is well now, it is quiet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said the Jungfrau. &lsquo;But we have gossipped enough, old fellow. It&rsquo;s
      time to slumber.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is time, indeed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The huge mountains sleep; the green, clear sky sleeps over the region of
      eternal silence.

    <h2>
      THE OLD WOMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was walking over a wide plain alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly I fancied light, cautious footsteps behind my back.... Some
      one was walking after me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked round, and saw a little, bent old woman, all muffled up in grey
      rags. The face of the old woman alone peeped out from them; a yellow,
      wrinkled, sharp-nosed, toothless face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to her.... She stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are you? What do you want? Are you a beggar? Do you seek alms?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman did not answer. I bent down to her, and noticed that both
      her eyes were covered with a half-transparent membrane or skin, such as is
      seen in some birds; they protect their eyes with it from dazzling light.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the old woman, the membrane did not move nor uncover the eyes ...
      from which I concluded she was blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you want alms?&rsquo; I repeated my question. &lsquo;Why are you following me?&rsquo;
      But the old woman as before made no answer, but only shrank into herself a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned from her and went on my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again I hear behind me the same light, measured, as it were, stealthy
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Again that woman!&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;why does she stick to me?&rsquo; But then, I
      added inwardly, &lsquo;Most likely she has lost her way, being blind, and now is
      following the sound of my steps so as to get with me to some inhabited
      place. Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But a strange uneasiness gradually gained possession of my mind. I began
      to fancy that the old woman was not only following me, but that she was
      directing me, that she was driving me to right and to left, and that I was
      unwittingly obeying her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still go on, however ... but, behold, before me, on my very road,
      something black and wide ... a kind of hole.... &lsquo;A grave!&rsquo; flashed through
      my head. &lsquo;That is where she is driving me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned sharply back. The old woman faced me again ... but she sees! She
      is looking at me with big, cruel, malignant eyes ... the eyes of a bird of
      prey.... I stoop down to her face, to her eyes.... Again the same opaque
      membrane, the same blind, dull countenance....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; I think, &lsquo;this old woman is my fate. The fate from which there is no
      escape for man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No escape! no escape! What madness.... One must try.&rsquo; And I rush away in
      another direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      I go swiftly.... But light footsteps as before patter behind me, close,
      close.... And before me again the dark hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I turn another way.... And again the same patter behind, and the
      same menacing blur of darkness before.
    </p>
    <p>
      And whichever way I run, doubling like a hunted hare ... it&rsquo;s always the
      same, the same!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait!&rsquo; I think, &lsquo;I will cheat her! I will go nowhere!&rsquo; and I instantly
      sat down on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman stands behind, two paces from me. I do not hear her, but I
      feel she is there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly I see the blur of darkness in the distance is floating,
      creeping of itself towards me!
    </p>
    <p>
      God! I look round again ... the old woman looks straight at me, and her
      toothless mouth is twisted in a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      No escape!

    <h2>
      THE DOG
    </h2>
    <p>
      Us two in the room; my dog and me.... Outside a fearful storm is howling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog sits in front of me, and looks me straight in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I, too, look into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wants, it seems, to tell me something. He is dumb, he is without words,
      he does not understand himself&mdash;but I understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand that at this instant there is living in him and in me the
      same feeling, that there is no difference between us. We are the same; in
      each of us there burns and shines the same trembling spark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death sweeps down, with a wave of its chill broad wing....
    </p>
    <p>
      And the end!
    </p>
    <p>
      Who then can discern what was the spark that glowed in each of us?
    </p>
    <p>
      No! We are not beast and man that glance at one another....
    </p>
    <p>
      They are the eyes of equals, those eyes riveted on one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in each of these, in the beast and in the man, the same life huddles
      up in fear close to the other.

    <h2>
      MY ADVERSARY
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had a comrade who was my adversary; not in pursuits, nor in service, nor
      in love, but our views were never alike on any subject, and whenever we
      met, endless argument arose between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We argued about everything: about art, and religion, and science, about
      life on earth and beyond the grave, especially about life beyond the
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a person of faith and enthusiasm. One day he said to me, &lsquo;You laugh
      at everything; but if I die before you, I will come to you from the other
      world.... We shall see whether you will laugh then.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did, in fact, die before me, while he was still young; but the
      years went by, and I had forgotten his promise, his threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night I was lying in bed, and could not, and, indeed, would not sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the room it was neither dark nor light. I fell to staring into the grey
      twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all at once, I fancied that between the two windows my adversary was
      standing, and was slowly and mournfully nodding his head up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not frightened; I was not even surprised ... but raising myself a
      little, and propping myself on my elbow, I stared still more intently at
      the unexpected apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter continued to nod his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; I said at last; &lsquo;are you triumphant or regretful? What is this&mdash;warning
      or reproach?... Or do you mean to give me to understand that you were
      wrong, that we were both wrong? What are you experiencing? The torments of
      hell? Or the bliss of paradise? Utter one word at least!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But my opponent did not utter a single sound, and only, as before,
      mournfully and submissively nodded his head up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed ... he vanished.

      THE BEGGAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was walking along the street ... I was stopped by a decrepit old beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bloodshot, tearful eyes, blue lips, coarse rags, festering wounds.... Oh,
      how hideously poverty had eaten into this miserable creature!
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out to me a red, swollen, filthy hand. He groaned, he mumbled of
      help.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began feeling in all my pockets.... No purse, no watch, not even a
      handkerchief.... I had taken nothing with me. And the beggar was still
      waiting ... and his outstretched hand feebly shook and trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confused, abashed, I warmly clasped the filthy, shaking hand ... &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      angry, brother; I have nothing, brother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The beggar stared at me with his bloodshot eyes; his blue lips smiled; and
      he in his turn gripped my chilly fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What of it, brother?&rsquo; he mumbled; &lsquo;thanks for this, too. That is a gift
      too, brother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that I too had received a gift from my brother.

    <h2>
      &lsquo;THOU SHALT HEAR THE FOOL&rsquo;S JUDGMENT....&rsquo;&mdash;<i>PUSHKIN</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou shalt hear the fool&rsquo;s judgment....&rsquo; You always told the truth, O
      great singer of ours. You spoke it this time, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fool&rsquo;s judgment and the laughter of the crowd&rsquo; ... who has not known
      the one and the other?
    </p>
    <p>
      All that one can, and one ought to bear; and who has the strength, let him
      despise it!
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are blows which pierce more cruelly to the very heart.... A man
      has done all that he could; has worked strenuously, lovingly, honestly....
      And honest hearts turn from him in disgust; honest faces burn with
      indignation at his name. &lsquo;Be gone! Away with you!&rsquo; honest young voices
      scream at him. &lsquo;We have no need of you, nor of your work. You pollute our
      dwelling-places. You know us not and understand us not.... You are our
      enemy!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What is that man to do? Go on working; not try to justify himself, and not
      even look forward to a fairer judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time the tillers of the soil cursed the traveller who brought the
      potato, the substitute for bread, the poor man&rsquo;s daily food.... They shook
      the precious gift out of his outstretched hands, flung it in the mud,
      trampled it underfoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they are fed with it, and do not even know their benefactor&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      So be it! What is his name to them? He, nameless though he be, saves them
      from hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us try only that what we bring should be really good food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitter, unjust reproach on the lips of those you love.... But that, too,
      can be borne....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beat me! but listen!&rsquo; said the Athenian leader to the Spartan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beat me! but be healthy and fed!&rsquo; we ought to say.

      A CONTENTED MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      A young man goes skipping and bounding along a street in the capital. His
      movements are gay and alert; there is a sparkle in his eyes, a smirk on
      his lips, a pleasing flush on his beaming face.... He is all contentment
      and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      What has happened to him? Has he come in for a legacy? Has he been
      promoted? Is he hastening to meet his beloved? Or is it simply he has had
      a good breakfast, and the sense of health, the sense of well-fed
      prosperity, is at work in all his limbs? Surely they have not put on his
      neck thy lovely, eight-pointed cross, O Polish king, Stanislas?
    </p>
    <p>
      No. He has hatched a scandal against a friend, has sedulously sown it
      abroad, has heard it, this same slander, from the lips of another friend,
      and&mdash;<i>has himself believed it</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how contented! how kind indeed at this minute is this amiable,
      promising young man!

    <h2>
      A RULE OF LIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you want to annoy an opponent thoroughly, and even to harm him,&rsquo; said
      a crafty old knave to me, &lsquo;you reproach him with the very defect or vice
      you are conscious of in yourself. Be indignant ... and reproach him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To begin with, it will set others thinking you have not that vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the second place, your indignation may well be sincere.... You can
      turn to account the pricks of your own conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you, for instance, are a turncoat, reproach your opponent with having
      no convictions!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you are yourself slavish at heart, tell him reproachfully that he is
      slavish ... the slave of civilisation, of Europe, of Socialism!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One might even say, the slave of anti-slavishness,&rsquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might even do that,&rsquo; assented the cunning knave.

    <h2>
      THE END OF THE WORLD
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A DREAM
    </h3>
    <p>
      I fancied I was somewhere in Russia, in the wilds, in a simple country
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room big and low pitched with three windows; the walls whitewashed; no
      furniture. Before the house a barren plain; gradually sloping downwards,
      it stretches into the distance; a grey monotonous sky hangs over it, like
      the canopy of a bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not alone; there are some ten persons in the room with me. All quite
      plain people, simply dressed. They walk up and down in silence, as it were
      stealthily. They avoid one another, and yet are continually looking
      anxiously at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one knows why he has come into this house and what people there are
      with him. On all the faces uneasiness and despondency ... all in turn
      approach the windows and look about intently as though expecting something
      from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then again they fall to wandering up and down. Among us is a small-sized
      boy; from time to time he whimpers in the same thin voice, &lsquo;Father, I&rsquo;m
      frightened!&rsquo; My heart turns sick at his whimper, and I too begin to be
      afraid ... of what? I don&rsquo;t know myself. Only I feel, there is coming
      nearer and nearer a great, great calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy keeps on and on with his wail. Oh, to escape from here! How
      stifling! How weary! how heavy.... But escape is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      That sky is like a shroud. And no wind.... Is the air dead or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the boy runs up to the window and shrieks in the same piteous
      voice, &lsquo;Look! look! the earth has fallen away!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How? fallen away?&rsquo; Yes; just now there was a plain before the house, and
      now it stands on a fearful height! The horizon has sunk, has gone down,
      and from the very house drops an almost overhanging, as it were
      scooped-out, black precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all crowded to the window.... Horror froze our hearts. &lsquo;Here it is ...
      here it is!&rsquo; whispers one next me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And behold, along the whole far boundary of the earth, something began to
      stir, some sort of small, roundish hillocks began heaving and falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the sea!&rsquo; the thought flashed on us all at the same instant. &lsquo;It
      will swallow us all up directly.... Only how can it grow and rise upwards?
      To this precipice?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, it grows, grows enormously.... Already there are not separate
      hillocks heaving in the distance.... One continuous, monstrous wave
      embraces the whole circle of the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is swooping, swooping, down upon us! In an icy hurricane it flies,
      swirling in the darkness of hell. Everything shuddered&mdash;and there, in
      this flying mass&mdash;was the crash of thunder, the iron wail of
      thousands of throats....
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! what a roaring and moaning! It was the earth howling for terror....
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of it! the end of all!
    </p>
    <p>
      The child whimpered once more.... I tried to clutch at my companions, but
      already we were all crushed, buried, drowned, swept away by that
      pitch-black, icy, thundering wave! Darkness ... darkness everlasting!
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely breathing, I awoke.

    <h2>
      MASHA
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I lived, many years ago, in Petersburg, every time I chanced to hire
      a sledge, I used to get into conversation with the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was particularly fond of talking to the night drivers, poor peasants
      from the country round, who come to the capital with their little
      ochre-painted sledges and wretched nags, in the hope of earning food for
      themselves and rent for their masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one day I engaged such a sledge-driver.... He was a lad of twenty, tall
      and well-made, a splendid fellow with blue eyes and ruddy cheeks; his fair
      hair curled in little ringlets under the shabby little patched cap that
      was pulled over his eyes. And how had that little torn smock ever been
      drawn over those gigantic shoulders!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the handsome, beardless face of the sledge-driver looked mournful and
      downcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to talk to him. There was a sorrowful note in his voice too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it, brother?&rsquo; I asked him; &lsquo;why aren&rsquo;t you cheerful? Have you
      some trouble?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad did not answer me for a minute. &lsquo;Yes, sir, I have,&rsquo; he said at
      last. &lsquo;And such a trouble, there could not be a worse. My wife is dead.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You loved her ... your wife?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad did not turn to me; he only bent his head a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I loved her, sir. It&rsquo;s eight months since then ... but I can&rsquo;t forget it.
      My heart is gnawing at me ... so it is! And why had she to die? A young
      thing! strong!... In one day cholera snatched her away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And was she good to you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, sir!&rsquo; the poor fellow sighed heavily, &lsquo;and how happy we were
      together! She died without me! The first I heard here, they&rsquo;d buried her
      already, you know; I hurried off at once to the village, home&mdash;I got
      there&mdash;it was past midnight. I went into my hut, stood still in the
      middle of the room, and softly I whispered, &ldquo;Masha! eh, Masha!&rdquo; Nothing
      but the cricket chirping. I fell a-crying then, sat on the hut floor, and
      beat on the earth with my fists! &ldquo;Greedy earth!&rdquo; says I ... &ldquo;You have
      swallowed her up ... swallow me too!&mdash;Ah, Masha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Masha!&rsquo; he added suddenly in a sinking voice. And without letting go of
      the cord reins, he wiped the tears out of his eyes with his sleeve, shook
      it, shrugged his shoulders, and uttered not another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I got out of the sledge, I gave him a few coppers over his fare. He
      bowed low to me, grasping his cap in both hands, and drove off at a
      walking pace over the level snow of the deserted street, full of the grey
      fog of a January frost.

    <h2>
      THE FOOL
    </h2>
    <p>
      There lived a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time he lived in peace and contentment; but by degrees rumours
      began to reach him that he was regarded on all sides as a vulgar idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fool was abashed and began to ponder gloomily how he might put an end
      to these unpleasant rumours.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden idea, at last, illuminated his dull little brain.... And, without
      the slightest delay, he put it into practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend met him in the street, and fell to praising a well-known
      painter....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word!&rsquo; cried the fool,&rsquo; that painter was out of date long ago ...
      you didn&rsquo;t know it? I should never have expected it of you ... you are
      quite behind the times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The friend was alarmed, and promptly agreed with the fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such a splendid book I read yesterday!&rsquo; said another friend to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word!&rsquo; cried the fool, &lsquo;I wonder you&rsquo;re not ashamed. That book&rsquo;s
      good for nothing; every one&rsquo;s seen through it long ago. Didn&rsquo;t you know
      it? You&rsquo;re quite behind the times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This friend too was alarmed, and he agreed with the fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a wonderful fellow my friend N. N. is!&rsquo; said a third friend to the
      fool. &lsquo;Now there&rsquo;s a really generous creature!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word!&rsquo; cried the fool. &lsquo;N. N., the notorious scoundrel! He
      swindled all his relations. Every one knows that. You&rsquo;re quite behind the
      times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The third friend too was alarmed, and he agreed with the fool and deserted
      his friend. And whoever and whatever was praised in the fool&rsquo;s presence,
      he had the same retort for everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he would add reproachfully: &lsquo;And do you still believe in
      authorities?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Spiteful! malignant!&rsquo; his friends began to say of the fool. &lsquo;But what a
      brain!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what a tongue!&rsquo; others would add, &lsquo;Oh, yes, he has talent!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It ended in the editor of a journal proposing to the fool that he should
      undertake their reviewing column.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the fool fell to criticising everything and every one, without in the
      least changing his manner, or his exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he, who once declaimed against authorities, is himself an authority,
      and the young men venerate him, and fear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what else can they do, poor young men? Though one ought not, as a
      general rule, to venerate any one ... but in this case, if one didn&rsquo;t
      venerate him, one would find oneself quite behind the times!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fools have a good time among cowards.

    <h2>
      AN EASTERN LEGEND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Who in Bagdad knows not Jaffar, the Sun of the Universe?
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, many years ago (he was yet a youth), Jaffar was walking in the
      environs of Bagdad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a hoarse cry reached his ear; some one was calling desperately
      for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaffar was distinguished among the young men of his age by prudence and
      sagacity; but his heart was compassionate, and he relied on his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran at the cry, and saw an infirm old man, pinned to the city wall by
      two brigands, who were robbing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaffar drew his sabre and fell upon the miscreants: one he killed, the
      other he drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man thus liberated fell at his deliverer&rsquo;s feet, and, kissing the
      hem of his garment, cried: &lsquo;Valiant youth, your magnanimity shall not
      remain unrewarded. In appearance I am a poor beggar; but only in
      appearance. I am not a common man. Come to-morrow in the early morning to
      the chief bazaar; I will await you at the fountain, and you shall be
      convinced of the truth of my words.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaffar thought: &lsquo;In appearance this man is a beggar, certainly; but all
      sorts of things happen. Why not put it to the test?&rsquo; and he answered:
      &lsquo;Very well, good father; I will come.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked into his face, and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, the sun had hardly risen, Jaffar went to the bazaar. The
      old man was already awaiting him, leaning with his elbow on the marble
      basin of the fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence he took Jaffar by the hand and led him into a small garden,
      enclosed on all sides by high walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very middle of this garden, on a green lawn, grew an
      extraordinary-looking tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a cypress; only its leaves were of an azure hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three fruits&mdash;three apples&mdash;hung on the slender upward-bent
      twigs; one was of middle size, long-shaped, and milk-white; the second,
      large, round, bright-red; the third, small, wrinkled, yellowish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole tree faintly rustled, though there was no wind. It emitted a
      shrill plaintive ringing sound, as of a glass bell; it seemed it was
      conscious of Jaffar&rsquo;s approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Youth!&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;pick any one of these apples and know, if you
      pick and eat the white one, you will be the wisest of all men; if you pick
      and eat the red, you will be rich as the Jew Rothschild; if you pick and
      eat the yellow one, you will be liked by old women. Make up your mind! and
      do not delay. Within an hour the apples will wither, and the tree itself
      will sink into the dumb depths of the earth!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaffar looked down, and pondered. &lsquo;How am I to act?&rsquo; he said in an
      undertone, as though arguing with himself. &lsquo;If you become too wise, maybe
      you will not care to live; if you become richer than any one, every one
      will envy you; I had better pick and eat the third, the withered apple!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he did; and the old man laughed a toothless laugh, and said: &lsquo;O
      wise young man! You have chosen the better part! What need have you of the
      white apple? You are wiser than Solomon as it is. And you&rsquo;ve no need of
      the red apple either.... You will be rich without it. Only your wealth no
      one will envy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me, old man,&rsquo; said Jaffar, rousing himself, &lsquo;where lives the
      honoured mother of our Caliph, protected of heaven?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man bowed down to the earth, and pointed out to the young man the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who in Bagdad knows not the Sun of the Universe, the great, the renowned
      Jaffar?

    <h2>
      TWO STANZAS
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a town, the inhabitants of which were so passionately fond
      of poetry, that if some weeks passed by without the appearance of any good
      new poems, they regarded such a poetic dearth as a public misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      They used at such times to put on their worst clothes, to sprinkle ashes
      on their heads; and, assembling in crowds in the public squares, to shed
      tears and bitterly to upbraid the muse who had deserted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one such inauspicious day, the young poet Junius came into a square,
      thronged with the grieving populace.
    </p>
    <p>
      With rapid steps he ascended a forum constructed for this purpose, and
      made signs that he wished to recite a poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lictors at once brandished their fasces. &lsquo;Silence! attention!&rsquo; they
      shouted loudly, and the crowd was hushed in expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friends! Comrades!&rsquo; began Junius, in a loud but not quite steady voice:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Friends! Comrades! Lovers of the Muse!
  Ye worshippers of beauty and of grace!
  Let not a moment&rsquo;s gloom dismay your souls,
  Your heart&rsquo;s desire is nigh, and light shall banish darkness.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      Junius ceased ... and in answer to him, from every part of the square,
      rose a hubbub of hissing and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every face, turned to him, glowed with indignation, every eye sparkled
      with anger, every arm was raised and shook a menacing fist!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He thought to dazzle us with that!&rsquo; growled angry voices. &lsquo;Down with the
      imbecile rhymester from the forum! Away with the idiot! Rotten apples,
      stinking eggs for the motley fool! Give us stones&mdash;stones here!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Junius rushed head over heels from the forum ... but, before he had got
      home, he was overtaken by the sound of peals of enthusiastic applause,
      cries and shouts of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filled with amazement, Junius returned to the square, trying however to
      avoid being noticed (for it is dangerous to irritate an infuriated beast).
    </p>
    <p>
      And what did he behold?
    </p>
    <p>
      High above the people, upon their shoulders, on a flat golden shield,
      wrapped in a purple chlamys, with a laurel wreath on his flowing locks,
      stood his rival, the young poet Julius.... And the populace all round him
      shouted: &lsquo;Glory! Glory! Glory to the immortal Julius! He has comforted us
      in our sorrow, in our great woe! He has bestowed on us verses sweeter than
      honey, more musical than the cymbal&rsquo;s note, more fragrant than the rose,
      purer than the azure of heaven! Carry him in triumph, encircle his
      inspired head with the soft breath of incense, cool his brow with the
      rhythmic movement of palm-leaves, scatter at his feet all the fragrance of
      the myrrh of Arabia! Glory!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Junius went up to one of the applauding enthusiasts. &lsquo;Enlighten me, O my
      fellow-citizen! what were the verses with which Julius has made you happy?
      I, alas! was not in the square when he uttered them! Repeat them, if you
      remember them, pray!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Verses like those I could hardly forget!&rsquo; the man addressed responded
      with spirit. &lsquo;What do you take me for? Listen&mdash;and rejoice, rejoice
      with us!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lovers of the Muse!&rsquo; so the deified Julius had begun....
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Lovers of the Muse! Comrades! Friends
  Of beauty, grace, and music, worshippers!
  Let not your hearts by gloom affrighted be!
  The wished-for moment comes! and day shall scatter night!&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of them?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heavens!&rsquo; cried Junius; &lsquo;but that&rsquo;s my poem! Julius must have been in the
      crowd when I was reciting them; he heard them and repeated them, slightly
      varying, and certainly not improving, a few expressions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha! Now I recognise you.... You are Junius,&rsquo; the citizen he had stopped
      retorted with a scowl on his face. &lsquo;Envious man or fool!... note only,
      luckless wretch, how sublimely Julius has phrased it: &ldquo;And day shall
      scatter night!&rdquo; While you had some such rubbish: &ldquo;And light shall banish
      darkness!&rdquo; What light? What darkness?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But isn&rsquo;t that just the same?&rsquo; Junius was beginning....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say another word,&rsquo; the citizen cut him short, &lsquo;I will call upon the
      people ... they will tear you to pieces!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Junius judiciously held his peace, but a grey-headed old man who had heard
      the conversation went up to the unlucky poet, and laying a hand upon his
      shoulder, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Junius! You uttered your own thought, but not at the right moment; and he
      uttered not his own thought, but at the right moment. Consequently, he is
      all right; while for you is left the consolations of a good conscience.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But while his conscience, to the best of its powers&mdash;not over
      successfully, to tell the truth&mdash;was consoling Junius as he was
      shoved on one side&mdash;in the distance, amid shouts of applause and
      rejoicing, in the golden radiance of the all-conquering sun, resplendent
      in purple, with his brow shaded with laurel, among undulating clouds of
      lavish incense, with majestic deliberation, like a tsar making a triumphal
      entry into his kingdom, moved the proudly erect figure of Julius ... and
      the long branches of palm rose and fell before him, as though expressing
      in their soft vibration, in their submissive obeisance, the ever-renewed
      adoration which filled the hearts of his enchanted fellow-citizens!

    <h2>
      THE SPARROW
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was returning from hunting, and walking along an avenue of the garden,
      my dog running in front of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he took shorter steps, and began to steal along as though
      tracking game.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked along the avenue, and saw a young sparrow, with yellow about its
      beak and down on its head. It had fallen out of the nest (the wind was
      violently shaking the birch-trees in the avenue) and sat unable to move,
      helplessly flapping its half-grown wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dog was slowly approaching it, when, suddenly darting down from a tree
      close by, an old dark-throated sparrow fell like a stone right before his
      nose, and all ruffled up, terrified, with despairing and pitiful cheeps,
      it flung itself twice towards the open jaws of shining teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sprang to save; it cast itself before its nestling ... but all its tiny
      body was shaking with terror; its note was harsh and strange. Swooning
      with fear, it offered itself up!
    </p>
    <p>
      What a huge monster must the dog have seemed to it! And yet it could not
      stay on its high branch out of danger.... A force stronger than its will
      flung it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Trésor stood still, drew back.... Clearly he too recognised this force.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to call off the disconcerted dog, and went away, full of
      reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; do not laugh. I felt reverence for that tiny heroic bird, for its
      impulse of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love, I thought, is stronger than death or the fear of death. Only by it,
      by love, life holds together and advances.

      THE SKULLS
    </h2>
    <p>
      A sumptuous, brilliantly lighted hall; a number of ladies and gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the faces are animated, the talk is lively.... A noisy conversation is
      being carried on about a famous singer. They call her divine, immortal....
      O, how finely yesterday she rendered her last trill!
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly&mdash;as by the wave of an enchanter&rsquo;s wand&mdash;from every
      head and from every face, slipped off the delicate covering of skin, and
      instantaneously exposed the deadly whiteness of skulls, with here and
      there the leaden shimmer of bare jaws and gums.
    </p>
    <p>
      With horror I beheld the movements of those jaws and gums; the turning,
      the glistening in the light of the lamps and candles, of those lumpy bony
      balls, and the rolling in them of other smaller balls, the balls of the
      meaningless eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dared not touch my own face, dared not glance at myself in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the skulls turned from side to side as before.... And with their
      former noise, peeping like little red rags out of the grinning teeth,
      rapid tongues lisped how marvellously, how inimitably the immortal ...
      yes, immortal ... singer had rendered that last trill!

      THE WORKMAN AND THE MAN WITH WHITE HANDS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A DIALOGUE
    </h3>
    <p>
      WORKMAN. Why do you come crawling up to us? What do ye want? You&rsquo;re none
      of us.... Get along!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAN WITH WHITE HANDS. I am one of you, comrades!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE WORKMAN. One of us, indeed! That&rsquo;s a notion! Look at my hands. D&rsquo;ye
      see how dirty they are? And they smell of muck, and of pitch&mdash;but
      yours, see, are white. And what do they smell of?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MAN WITH WHITE HANDS (<i>offering his hands</i>). Smell them.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE WORKMAN (<i>sniffing his hands</i>). That&rsquo;s a queer start. Seems like
      a smell of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MAN WITH WHITE HANDS. Yes; iron it is. For six long years I wore
      chains on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE WORKMAN. And what was that for, pray?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MAN WITH WHITE HANDS. Why, because I worked for your good; tried to
      set free the oppressed and the ignorant; stirred folks up against your
      oppressors; resisted the authorities.... So they locked me up.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE WORKMAN. Locked you up, did they? Serve you right for resisting!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Two Years Later</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SAME WORKMAN TO ANOTHER. I say, Pete.... Do you remember, the year
      before last, a chap with white hands talking to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OTHER WORKMAN. Yes;... what of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIRST WORKMAN. They&rsquo;re going to hang him to-day, I heard say; that&rsquo;s
      the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND WORKMAN. Did he keep on resisting the authorities?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIRST WORKMAN. He kept on.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND WORKMAN. Ah!... Now, I say, mate, couldn&rsquo;t we get hold of a bit
      of the rope they&rsquo;re going to hang him with? They do say, it brings good
      luck to a house!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIRST WORKMAN. You&rsquo;re right there. We&rsquo;ll have a try for it, mate.

    <h2>
      THE ROSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The last days of August.... Autumn was already at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was setting. A sudden downpour of rain, without thunder or
      lightning, had just passed rapidly over our wide plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The garden in front of the house glowed and steamed, all filled with the
      fire of the sunset and the deluge of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting at a table in the drawing-room, and, with persistent
      dreaminess, gazing through the half-open door into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew what was passing at that moment in her soul; I knew that, after a
      brief but agonising struggle, she was at that instant giving herself up to
      a feeling she could no longer master.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once she got up, went quickly out into the garden, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed ... a second; she had not returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I got up, and, getting out of the house, I turned along the walk by
      which&mdash;of that I had no doubt&mdash;she had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was darkness about me; the night had already fallen. But on the damp
      sand of the path a roundish object could be discerned&mdash;bright red
      even through the mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stooped down. It was a fresh, new-blown rose. Two hours before I had
      seen this very rose on her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I carefully picked up the flower that had fallen in the mud, and, going
      back to the drawing-room, laid it on the table before her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now at last she came back, and with light footsteps, crossing the
      whole room, sat down at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was both paler and more vivid; her downcast eyes, that looked
      somehow smaller, strayed rapidly in happy confusion from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the rose, snatched it up, glanced at its crushed, muddy petals,
      glanced at me, and her eyes, brought suddenly to a standstill, were bright
      with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you crying for?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, see this rose. Look what has happened to it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I thought fit to utter a profound remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your tears will wash away the mud,&rsquo; I pronounced with a significant
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tears do not wash, they burn,&rsquo; she answered. And turning to the hearth
      she flung the rose into the dying flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fire burns even better than tears,&rsquo; she cried with spirit; and her lovely
      eyes, still bright with tears, laughed boldly and happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that she too had been in the fire.

      TO THE MEMORY OF U. P. VREVSKY
    </h2>
    <p>
      On dirt, on stinking wet straw under the shelter of a tumble-down barn,
      turned in haste into a camp hospital, in a ruined Bulgarian village, for
      over a fortnight she lay dying of typhus.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was unconscious, and not one doctor even looked at her; the sick
      soldiers, whom she had tended as long as she could keep on her legs, in
      their turn got up from their pestilent litters to lift a few drops of
      water in the hollow of a broken pot to her parched lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was young and beautiful; the great world knew her; even the highest
      dignitaries had been interested in her. Ladies had envied her, men had
      paid her court ... two or three had loved her secretly and truly. Life had
      smiled on her; but there are smiles that are worse than tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft, tender heart ... and such force, such eagerness for sacrifice! To
      help those who needed help ... she knew of no other happiness ... knew not
      of it, and had never once known it. Every other happiness passed her by.
      But she had long made up her mind to that; and all aglow with the fire of
      unquenchable faith, she gave herself to the service of her neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      What hidden treasure she buried there in the depth of her heart, in her
      most secret soul, no one ever knew; and now, of course, no one will ever
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, and what need? Her sacrifice is made ... her work is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      But grievous it is to think that no one said thanks even to her dead body,
      though she herself was shy and shrank from all thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      May her dear shade pardon this belated blossom, which I make bold to lay
      upon her grave!

      THE LAST MEETING
    </h2>
    <p>
      We had once been close and warm friends.... But an unlucky moment came ...
      and we parted as enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years passed by.... And coming to the town where he lived, I learnt
      that he was helplessly ill, and wished to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made my way to him, went into his room.... Our eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hardly knew him. God! what sickness had done to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yellow, wrinkled, completely bald, with a scanty grey beard, he sat
      clothed in nothing but a shirt purposely slit open.... He could not bear
      the weight of even the lightest clothes. Jerkily he stretched out to me
      his fearfully thin hand that looked as if it were gnawed away, with an
      effort muttered a few indistinct words&mdash;whether of welcome or
      reproach, who can tell? His emaciated chest heaved, and over the dwindled
      pupils of his kindling eyes rolled two hard-wrung tears of suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart sank.... I sat down on a chair beside him, and involuntarily
      dropping my eyes before the horror and hideousness of it, I too held out
      my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it seemed to me that it was not his hand that took hold of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that between us is sitting a tall, still, white woman. A
      long robe shrouds her from head to foot. Her deep, pale eyes look into
      vacancy; no sound is uttered by her pale, stern lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      This woman has joined our hands.... She has reconciled us for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.... Death has reconciled us....

    <h2>
      A VISIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was sitting at the open window ... in the morning, the early morning of
      the first of May.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dawn had not yet begun; but already the dark, warm night grew pale and
      chill at its approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      No mist had risen, no breeze was astir, all was colourless and still ...
      but the nearness of the awakening could be felt, and the rarer air smelt
      keen and moist with dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, at the open window, with a light whirr and rustle, a great bird
      flew into my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started, looked closely at it.... It was not a bird; it was a tiny
      winged woman, dressed in a narrow long robe flowing to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was grey all over, the colour of mother-of-pearl; only the inner side
      of her wings glowed with the tender flush of an opening rose; a wreath of
      valley lilies entwined the scattered curls upon her little round head;
      and, like a butterfly&rsquo;s feelers, two peacock feathers waved drolly above
      her lovely rounded brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fluttered twice about the ceiling; her tiny face was laughing;
      laughing, too, were her great, clear, black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gay frolic of her sportive flight set them flashing like diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held in her hand the long stalk of a flower of the steppes&mdash;&lsquo;the
      Tsar&rsquo;s sceptre,&rsquo; the Russians call it&mdash;it is really like a sceptre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flying rapidly above me, she touched my head with the flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rushed towards her.... But already she had fluttered out of window, and
      darted away....
    </p>
    <p>
      In the garden, in a thicket of lilac bushes, a wood-dove greeted her with
      its first morning warble ... and where she vanished, the milk-white sky

      I know thee, Goddess of Fantasy! Thou didst pay me a random visit by the
      way; thou hast flown on to the young poets.

      O Poesy! Youth! Virginal beauty of woman! Thou couldst shine for me but
      for a moment, in the early dawn of early spring!

      A BAS-RELIEF

      A tall, bony old woman, with iron face and dull, fixed look, moves with

      woman.
    </p>

      This woman&mdash;of huge stature, powerful, thick-set, with the muscles of

    <p>
      This girl alone has eyes that see; she resists, turns round, lifts fair,
      delicate hands; her face, full of life, shows impatience and daring....
      She wants not to obey, she wants not to go, where they are driving her ...
      but, still, she has to yield and go.

    <h2>
      ALMS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Near a large town, along the broad highroad walked an old sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tottered as he went; his old wasted legs, halting, dragging, stumbling,
      moved painfully and feebly, as though they did not belong to him; his
      clothes hung in rags about him; his uncovered head drooped on his
      breast.... He was utterly worn-out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on a stone by the wayside, bent forward, leant his elbows on
      his knees, hid his face in his hands; and through the knotted fingers the
      tears dropped down on to the grey, dry dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered....
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembered how he too had been strong and rich, and how he had wasted his
      health, and had lavished his riches upon others, friends and enemies....
      And here, he had not now a crust of bread; and all had forsaken him,
      friends even before foes.... Must he sink to begging alms? There was
      bitterness in his heart, and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears still dropped and dropped, spotting the grey dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he heard some one call him by his name; he lifted his weary head,
      and saw standing before him a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A face calm and grave, but not stern; eyes not beaming, but clear; a look
      penetrating, but not unkind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou hast given away all thy riches,&rsquo; said a tranquil voice.... &lsquo;But thou
      dost not regret having done good, surely?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I regret it not,&rsquo; answered the old man with a sigh; &lsquo;but here I am dying
      now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And had there been no beggars who held out their hands to thee,&rsquo; the
      stranger went on, &lsquo;thou wouldst have had none on whom to prove thy
      goodness; thou couldst not have done thy good works.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man answered nothing, and pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So be thou also now not proud, poor man,&rsquo; the stranger began again. &lsquo;Go
      thou, hold out thy hand; do thou too give to other good men a chance to
      prove in deeds that they are good.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man started, raised his eyes ... but already the stranger had
      vanished, and in the distance a man came into sight walking along the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man went up to him, and held out his hand. This man turned away
      with a surly face, and gave him nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after him another passed, and he gave the old man some trifling alms.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the old man bought himself bread with the coppers given him, and sweet
      to him seemed the morsel gained by begging, and there was no shame in his
      heart, but the contrary: peace and joy came as a blessing upon him.

    <h2>
      THE INSECT
    </h2>
    <p>
      I dreamed that we were sitting, a party of twenty, in a big room with open
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among us were women, children, old men.... We were all talking of some
      very well-known subject, talking noisily and indistinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, with a sharp, whirring sound, there flew into the room a big
      insect, two inches long ... it flew in, circled round, and settled on the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a fly or a wasp. Its body dirt-coloured; of the same colour
      too its flat, stiff wings; outspread feathered claws, and a head thick and
      angular, like a dragon-fly&rsquo;s; both head and claws were bright red, as
      though steeped in blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      This strange insect incessantly turned its head up and down, to right and
      to left, moved its claws ... then suddenly darted from the wall, flew with
      a whirring sound about the room, and again settled, again hatefully and
      loathsomely wriggling all over, without stirring from the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all of us it excited a sensation of loathing, dread, even terror.... No
      one of us had ever seen anything like it. We all cried: &lsquo;Drive that
      monstrous thing away!&rsquo; and waved our handkerchiefs at it from a distance
      ... but no one ventured to go up to it ... and when the insect began
      flying, every one instinctively moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one of our party, a pale-faced young man, stared at us all in
      amazement He shrugged his shoulders; he smiled, and positively could not
      conceive what had happened to us, and why we were in such a state of
      excitement. He himself did not see an insect at all, did not hear the
      ill-omened whirr of its wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the insect seemed to stare at him, darted off, and dropping on
      his head, stung him on the forehead, above the eyes.... The young man
      feebly groaned, and fell dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fearful fly flew out at once.... Only then we guessed what it was had
      visited us.

    <h2>
      CABBAGE SOUP
    </h2>
    <p>
      A peasant woman, a widow, had an only son, a young man of twenty, the best
      workman in the village, and he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady who was the owner of the village, hearing of the woman&rsquo;s trouble,
      went to visit her on the very day of the burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found her at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing in the middle of her hut, before the table, she was, without
      haste, with a regular movement of the right arm (the left hung listless at
      her side), scooping up weak cabbage soup from the bottom of a blackened
      pot, and swallowing it spoonful by spoonful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s face was sunken and dark; her eyes were red and swollen ...
      but she held herself as rigid and upright as in church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heavens!&rsquo; thought the lady, &lsquo;she can eat at such a moment ... what coarse
      feelings they have really, all of them!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at that point the lady recollected that when, a few years before, she
      had lost her little daughter, nine months old, she had refused, in her
      grief, a lovely country villa near Petersburg, and had spent the whole
      summer in town! Meanwhile the woman went on swallowing cabbage soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady could not contain herself, at last. &lsquo;Tatiana!&rsquo; she said ...
      &lsquo;Really! I&rsquo;m surprised! Is it possible you didn&rsquo;t care for your son? How
      is it you&rsquo;ve not lost your appetite? How can you eat that soup!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Vasia&rsquo;s dead,&rsquo; said the woman quietly, and tears of anguish ran once
      more down her hollow cheeks. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the end of me too, of course; it&rsquo;s
      tearing the heart out of me alive. But the soup&rsquo;s not to be wasted;
      there&rsquo;s salt in it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady only shrugged her shoulders and went away. Salt did not cost her
      much.

    <h2>
      THE REALM OF AZURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      O realm of azure! O realm of light and colour, of youth and happiness! I
      have beheld thee in dream. We were together, a few, in a beautiful little
      boat, gaily decked out. Like a swan&rsquo;s breast the white sail swelled below
      the streamers frolicking in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew not who were with me; but in all my soul I felt that they were
      young, light-hearted, happy as I!
    </p>
    <p>
      But I looked not indeed on them. I beheld all round the boundless blue of
      the sea, dimpled with scales of gold, and overhead the same boundless sea
      of blue, and in it, triumphant and mirthful, it seemed, moved the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      And among us, ever and anon, rose laughter, ringing and gleeful as the
      laughter of the gods!
    </p>
    <p>
      And on a sudden, from one man&rsquo;s lips or another&rsquo;s, would flow words, songs
      of divine beauty and inspiration, and power ... it seemed the sky itself
      echoed back a greeting to them, and the sea quivered in unison.... Then
      followed again the blissful stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riding lightly over the soft waves, swiftly our little boat sped on. No
      wind drove it along; our own lightly beating hearts guided it. At our will
      it floated, obedient as a living thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came on islands, enchanted islands, half-transparent with the prismatic
      lights of precious stones, of amethysts and emeralds. Odours of
      bewildering fragrance rose from the rounded shores; some of these islands
      showered on us a rain of roses and valley lilies; from others birds darted
      up, with long wings of rainbow hues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The birds flew circling above us; the lilies and roses melted away in the
      pearly foam that glided by the smooth sides of our boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with the flowers and the birds, sounds floated to us, sounds sweet as
      honey ... women&rsquo;s voices, one fancied, in them.... And all about us, sky,
      sea, the heaving sail aloft, the gurgling water at the rudder&mdash;all
      spoke of love, of happy love!
    </p>
    <p>
      And she, the beloved of each of us&mdash;she was there ... unseen and
      close. One moment more, and behold, her eyes will shine upon thee, her
      smile will blossom on thee.... Her hand will take thy hand and guide thee
      to the land of joy that fades not!
    </p>
    <p>
      O realm of azure! In dream have I beheld thee.

      TWO RICH MEN

      When I hear the praises of the rich man Rothschild, who out of his immense
      revenues devotes whole thousands to the education of children, the care of
      the sick, the support of the aged, I admire and am touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even while I admire it and am touched by it, I cannot help recalling a
      poor peasant family who took an orphan niece into their little tumble-down
      hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we take Katka,&rsquo; said the woman, &lsquo;our last farthing will go on her,
      there won&rsquo;t be enough to get us salt to salt us a bit of bread.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,... we&rsquo;ll do without salt,&rsquo; answered the peasant, her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rothschild is a long way behind that peasant!

    <p>
      Two friends were sitting at a table drinking tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden hubbub arose in the street. They heard pitiable groans, furious
      abuse, bursts of malignant laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re beating some one,&rsquo; observed one of the friends, looking out of

      &lsquo;A criminal? A murderer?&rsquo; inquired the other. &lsquo;I say, whatever he may be,

    <h2>
      THE TWO BROTHERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a vision ...
    </p>
    <p>
      Two angels appeared to me ... two genii.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say angels, genii, because both had no clothes on their naked bodies,
      and behind their shoulders rose long powerful wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were youths. One was rather plump, with soft smooth skin and dark
      curls. His eyes were brown and full, with thick eyelashes; his look was
      sly, merry, and eager. His face was charming, bewitching, a little
      insolent, a little wicked. His full soft crimson lips were faintly
      quivering. The youth smiled as one possessing power&mdash;self-confidently
      and languidly; a magnificent wreath of flowers rested lightly on his
      shining tresses, almost touching his velvety eyebrows. A spotted leopard&rsquo;s
      skin, pinned up with a golden arrow, hung lightly from his curved shoulder
      to his rounded thigh. The feathers of his wings were tinged with rose
      colour; the ends of them were bright red, as though dipped in fresh-spilt
      scarlet blood. From time to time they quivered rapidly with a sweet
      silvery sound, the sound of rain in spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other was thin, and his skin yellowish. At every breath his ribs could
      be seen faintly heaving. His hair was fair, thin, and straight; his eyes
      big, round, pale grey ... his glance uneasy and strangely bright. All his
      features were sharp; the little half-open mouth, with pointed fish-like
      teeth; the pinched eagle nose, the projecting chin, covered with whitish
      down. The parched lips never once smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a well-cut face, but terrible and pitiless! (Though the face of the
      first, the beautiful youth, sweet and lovely as it was, showed no trace of
      pity either.) About the head of the second youth were twisted a few broken
      and empty ears of corn, entwined with faded grass-stalks. A coarse grey
      cloth girt his loins; the wings behind, a dull dark grey colour, moved
      slowly and menacingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two youths seemed inseparable companions. Each of them leaned upon the
      other&rsquo;s shoulder. The soft hand of the first lay like a cluster of grapes
      upon the bony neck of the second; the slender wrist of the second, with
      its long delicate fingers, coiled like a snake about the girlish bosom of
      the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I heard a voice. This is what it said: &lsquo;Love and Hunger stand before
      thee&mdash;twin brothers, the two foundation-stones of all things living.

    <h2>
      THE EGOIST
    </h2>
    <p>
      He had every qualification for becoming the scourge of his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was born healthy, was born wealthy, and throughout the whole of his
      long life, continuing to be wealthy and healthy, he never committed a
      single sin, never fell into a single error, never once made a slip or a
      blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was irreproachably conscientious!... And complacent in the sense of his
      own conscientiousness, he crushed every one with it, his family, his
      friends and his acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      His conscientiousness was his capital ... and he exacted an exorbitant
      interest for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His conscientiousness gave him the right to be merciless, and to do no
      good deeds beyond what it dictated to him; and he was merciless, and did
      no good ... for good that is dictated is no good at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took no interest in any one except his own exemplary self, and was
      genuinely indignant if others did not take as studious an interest in it!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time he did not consider himself an egoist, and was
      particularly severe in censuring, and keen in detecting egoists and
      egoism. To be sure he was. The egoism of another was a check on his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not recognising the smallest weakness in himself he did not understand,
      did not tolerate any weakness in any one. He did not, in fact, understand
      any one or any thing, since he was all, on all sides, above and below,
      before and behind, encircled by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not even understand the meaning of forgiveness. He had never had to
      forgive himself.... What inducement could he have to forgive others?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the tribunal of his own conscience, before the face of his own God,
      he, this marvel, this monster of virtue, raised his eyes heavenwards, and
      with clear unfaltering voice declared, &lsquo;Yes, I am an exemplary, a truly
      moral man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He will repeat these words on his deathbed, and there will be no throb
      even then in his heart of stone&mdash;in that heart without stain or
      blemish!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, hideousness of self-complacent, unbending, cheaply bought virtue; thou
      art almost more revolting than the frank hideousness of vice!

      THE BANQUET OF THE SUPREME BEING
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day the Supreme Being took it into his head to give a great banquet in
      his palace of azure.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the virtues were invited. Only the virtues ... men he did not ask ...
      only ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a great many of them, great and small. The lesser virtues were
      more agreeable and genial than the great ones; but they all appeared in
      good humour, and chatted amiably together, as was only becoming for near
      relations and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Supreme Being noticed two charming ladies who seemed to be totally
      unacquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Host gave one of the ladies his arm and led her up to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beneficence!&rsquo; he said, indicating the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gratitude!&rsquo; he added, indicating the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the virtues were amazed beyond expression; ever since the world had
      stood, and it had been standing a long time, this was the first time they
      had met.

      THE SPHINX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yellowish-grey sand, soft at the top, hard, grating below ... sand without
      end, where-ever one looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And above this sandy desert, above this sea of dead dust, rises the
      immense head of the Egyptian sphinx.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would they say, those thick, projecting lips, those immutable,
      distended, upturned nostrils, and those eyes, those long, half-drowsy,
      half-watchful eyes under the double arch of the high brows?
    </p>
    <p>
      Something they would say. They are speaking, truly, but only Oedipus can
      solve the riddle and comprehend their mute speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay, but I know those features ... in them there is nothing Egyptian.
      White, low brow, prominent cheek-bones, nose short and straight, handsome
      mouth and white teeth, soft moustache and curly beard, and those wide-set,
      not large eyes ... and on the head the cap of hair parted down the
      middle.... But it is thou, Karp, Sidor, Semyon, peasant of Yaroslav, of
      Ryazan, my countryman, flesh and blood, Russian! Art thou, too, among the
      sphinxes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Wouldst thou, too, say somewhat? Yes, and thou, too, art a sphinx.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thy eyes, those colourless, deep eyes, are speaking too ... and as
      mute and enigmatic is their speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where is thy Oedipus?
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! it&rsquo;s not enough to don the peasant smock to become thy Oedipus, oh
      Sphinx of all the Russias!

    <h2>
      THE NYMPHS
    </h2>
    <p>
      I stood before a chain of beautiful mountains forming a semicircle. A
      young, green forest covered them from summit to base.
    </p>
    <p>
      Limpidly blue above them was the southern sky; on the heights the sunbeams
      rioted; below, half-hidden in the grass, swift brooks were babbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the old fable came to my mind, how in the first century after Christ&rsquo;s
      birth, a Greek ship was sailing on the Aegean Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour was mid-day.... It was still weather. And suddenly up aloft,
      above the pilot&rsquo;s head, some one called distinctly, &lsquo;When thou sailest by
      the island, shout in a loud voice, &ldquo;Great Pan is dead!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilot was amazed ... afraid. But when the ship passed the island, he
      obeyed, he called, &lsquo;Great Pan is dead!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, at once, in response to his shout, all along the coast (though the
      island was uninhabited), sounded loud sobs, moans, long-drawn-out,
      plaintive wailings. &lsquo;Dead! dead is great Pan!&rsquo; I recalled this story ...
      and a strange thought came to. &lsquo;What if I call an invocation?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the sight of the exultant beauty around me, I could not think of
      death, and with all my might I shouted, &lsquo;Great Pan is arisen! arisen!&rsquo; And
      at once, wonder of wonders, in answer to my call, from all the wide
      half-circle of green mountains came peals of joyous laughter, rose the
      murmur of glad voices and the clapping of hands. &lsquo;He is arisen! Pan is
      arisen!&rsquo; clamoured fresh young voices. Everything before me burst into
      sudden laughter, brighter than the sun on high, merrier than the brooks
      that babbled among the grass. I heard the hurried thud of light steps,
      among the green undergrowth there were gleams of the marble white of
      flowing tunics, the living flush of bare limbs.... It was the nymphs,
      nymphs, dryads, Bacchantes, hastening from the heights down to the
      plain....
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once they appear at every opening in the woods. Their curls float
      about their god-like heads, their slender hands hold aloft wreaths and
      cymbals, and laughter, sparkling, Olympian laughter, comes leaping,
      dancing with them....
    </p>
    <p>
      Before them moves a goddess. She is taller and fairer than the rest; a
      quiver on her shoulder, a bow in her hands, a silvery crescent moon on her
      floating tresses....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Diana, is it thou?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly the goddess stopped ... and at once all the nymphs following
      her stopped. The ringing laughter died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see the face of the hushed goddess overspread with a deadly pallor; I
      saw her feet grew rooted to the ground, her lips parted in unutterable
      horror; her eyes grew wide, fixed on the distance ... What had she seen?
      What was she gazing upon?
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned where she was gazing ...
    </p>
    <p>
      And on the distant sky-line, above the low strip of fields, gleamed, like
      a point of fire the golden cross on the white bell-tower of a Christian
      church.... That cross the goddess had caught sight of.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard behind me a long, broken sigh, like the quiver of a broken string,
      and when I turned again, no trace was left of the nymphs.... The broad
      forest was green as before, and only here and there among the thick
      network of branches, were fading gleams of something white; whether the
      nymphs&rsquo; white robes, or a mist rising from the valley, I know not.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how I mourned for those vanished goddesses!

      FRIEND AND ENEMY
    </h2>
    <p>
      A prisoner, condemned to confinement for life, broke out of his prison and
      took to head-long flight.... After him, just on his heels flew his gaolers
      in pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran with all his might.... His pursuers began to be left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But behold, before him was a river with precipitous banks, a narrow, but
      deep river.... And he could not swim!
    </p>
    <p>
      A thin rotten plank had been thrown across from one bank to the other. The
      fugitive already had his foot upon it.... But it so happened that just
      there beside the river stood his best friend and his bitterest enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His enemy said nothing, he merely folded his arms; but the friend shrieked
      at the top of his voice: &lsquo;Heavens! What are you doing? Madman, think what
      you&rsquo;re about! Don&rsquo;t you see the plank&rsquo;s utterly rotten? It will break
      under your weight, and you will inevitably perish!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there is no other way to cross ... and don&rsquo;t you hear them in
      pursuit?&rsquo; groaned the poor wretch in despair, and he stepped on to the
      plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t allow it!... No, I won&rsquo;t allow you to rush to destruction!&rsquo; cried
      the zealous friend, and he snatched the plank from under the fugitive. The
      latter instantly fell into the boiling torrent, and was drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy smiled complacently, and walked away; but the friend sat down on
      the bank, and fell to weeping bitterly over his poor ... poor friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      To blame himself for his destruction did not however occur to him ... not
      for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He would not listen to me! He would not listen!&rsquo; he murmured dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Though indeed,&rsquo; he added at last. &lsquo;He would have had, to be sure, to
      languish his whole life long in an awful prison! At any rate, he is out of
      suffering now! He is better off now! Such was bound to be his fate, I
      suppose!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet I am sorry, from humane feeling!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the kind soul continued to sob inconsolably over the fate of his
      misguided friend.

    <h2>
      CHRIST
    </h2>
    <p>
      I saw myself, in dream, a youth, almost a boy, in a low-pitched wooden
      church. The slim wax candles gleamed, spots of red, before the old
      pictures of the saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ring of coloured light encircled each tiny flame. Dark and dim it was in
      the church.... But there stood before me many people. All fair-haired,
      peasant heads. From time to time they began swaying, falling, rising
      again, like the ripe ears of wheat, when the wind of summer passes in slow
      undulation over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once some man came up from behind and stood beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not turn towards him; but at once I felt that this man was Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emotion, curiosity, awe overmastered me suddenly. I made an effort ... and
      looked at my neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      A face like every one&rsquo;s, a face like all men&rsquo;s faces. The eyes looked a
      little upwards, quietly and intently. The lips closed, but not compressed;
      the upper lip, as it were, resting on the lower; a small beard parted in
      two. The hands folded and still. And the clothes on him like every one&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of Christ is this?&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;Such an ordinary, ordinary man!
      It can&rsquo;t be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned away. But I had hardly turned my eyes away from this ordinary man
      when I felt again that it really was none other than Christ standing
      beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I made an effort over myself.... And again the same face, like all
      men&rsquo;s faces, the same everyday though unknown features.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly my heart sank, and I came to myself. Only then I realised
      that just such a face&mdash;a face like all men&rsquo;s faces&mdash;is the face
      of Christ.

    <h3>
      [1879-1882]
    </h3>
    <p>
      Have you seen an old grey stone on the seashore, when at high tide, on a
      sunny day of spring, the living waves break upon it on all sides&mdash;break
      and frolic and caress it&mdash;and sprinkle over its sea-mossed head the
      scattered pearls of sparkling foam?
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone is still the same stone; but its sullen surface blossoms out
      into bright colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tell of those far-off days when the molten granite had but begun to
      harden, and was all aglow with the hues of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so of late was my old heart surrounded, broken in upon by a rush of
      fresh girls&rsquo; souls ... and under their caressing touch it flushed with
      long-faded colours, the traces of burnt-out fires!
    </p>
    <p>
      The waves have ebbed back ... but the colours are not yet dull, though a
      cutting wind is drying them.

    <h2>
      THE DOVES
    </h2>
    <p>
      I stood on the top of a sloping hillside; before me, a gold and silver sea
      of shifting colour, stretched the ripe rye.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no little wavelets ran over that sea; no stir of wind was in the
      stifling air; a great storm was gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near me the sun still shone with dusky fire; but beyond the rye, not very
      far away, a dark-blue storm-cloud lay, a menacing mass over full half of
      the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was hushed ... all things were faint under the malignant glare of the
      last sun rays. No sound, no sight of a bird; even the sparrows hid
      themselves. Only somewhere close by, persistently a great burdock leaf
      flapped and whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      How strong was the smell of the wormwood in the hedges! I looked at the
      dark-blue mass ... there was a vague uneasiness at my heart. &lsquo;Come then,
      quickly, quickly!&rsquo; was my thought, &lsquo;flash, golden snake, and roll thunder!
      move, hasten, break into floods, evil storm-cloud; cut short this agony of
      suspense!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the storm-cloud did not move. It lay as before, a stifling weight upon
      the hushed earth ... and only seemed to swell and darken.
    </p>
    <p>
      And lo, over its dead dusky-blue, something darted in smooth, even flight,
      like a white handkerchief or a handful of snow. It was a white dove flying
      from the direction of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      It flew, flew on straight ... and plunged into the forest. Some instants
      passed by&mdash;still the same cruel hush.... But, look! Two handkerchiefs
      gleam in the air, two handfuls of snow are floating back, two white doves
      are winging their way homewards with even flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now at last the storm has broken, and the tumult has begun!
    </p>
    <p>
      I could hardly get home. The wind howled, tossing hither and thither in
      frenzy; before it scudded low red clouds, torn, it seemed, into shreds;
      everything was whirled round in confusion; the lashing rain streamed in
      furious torrents down the upright trunks, flashes of lightning were
      blinding with greenish light, sudden peals of thunder boomed like
      cannon-shots, the air was full of the smell of sulphur....
    </p>
    <p>
      But under the overhanging roof, on the sill of the dormer window, side by
      side sat two white doves, the one who flew after his mate, and the mate he
      brought back, saved, perhaps, from destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sit ruffling up their feathers, and each feels his mate&rsquo;s wing
      against his wing....

      They are happy! And I am happy, seeing them.... Though I am alone ...
      alone, as always.

    <p>
      How empty, dull, and useless is almost every day when it is spent! How few
      the traces it leaves behind it! How meaningless, how foolish those hours
      as they coursed by one after another!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it is man&rsquo;s wish to exist; he prizes life, he rests hopes on it,

      future!
    </p>
    <p>
      But why does he imagine that other coming days will not be like this day
      he has just lived through?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, he does not even imagine it. He likes not to think at all, and he
      does well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, to-morrow, to-morrow!&rsquo; he comforts himself, till &lsquo;to-morrow&rsquo; pitches

    <p>
      Well, and once in the grave, thou hast no choice, thou doest no more

    <h2>
      NATURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      I dreamed I had come into an immense underground temple with lofty arched
      roof. It was filled with a sort of underground uniform light.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very middle of the temple sat a majestic woman in a flowing robe of
      green colour. Her head propped on her hand, she seemed buried in deep
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once I was aware that this woman was Nature herself; and a thrill of
      reverent awe sent an instantaneous shiver through my inmost soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      I approached the sitting figure, and making a respectful bow, &lsquo;O common
      Mother of us all!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;of what is thy meditation? Is it of the
      future destinies of man thou ponderest? or how he may attain the highest
      possible perfection and happiness?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman slowly turned upon me her dark menacing eyes. Her lips moved,
      and I heard a ringing voice like the clang of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am thinking how to give greater power to the leg-muscles of the flea,
      that he may more easily escape from his enemies. The balance of attack and
      defence is broken.... It must be restored.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What,&rsquo; I faltered in reply, &lsquo;what is it thou art thinking upon? But are
      not we, men, thy favourite children?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman frowned slightly. &lsquo;All creatures are my children,&rsquo; she
      pronounced, &lsquo;and I care for them alike, and all alike I destroy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But right ... reason ... justice ...&rsquo; I faltered again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those are men&rsquo;s words,&rsquo; I heard the iron voice saying. &lsquo;I know not right
      nor wrong.... Reason is no law for me&mdash;and what is justice?&mdash;I
      have given thee life, I shall take it away and give to others, worms or
      men ... I care not.... Do thou meanwhile look out for thyself, and hinder
      me not!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have retorted ... but the earth uttered a hollow groan and
      shuddered, and I awoke.

    <h2>
      &lsquo;HANG HIM!&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It happened in 1803,&rsquo; began my old acquaintance, &lsquo;not long before
      Austerlitz. The regiment in which I was an officer was quartered in
      Moravia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had strict orders not to molest or annoy the inhabitants; as it was,
      they regarded us very dubiously, though we were supposed to be allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had a servant, formerly a serf of my mother&rsquo;s, Yegor, by name. He was a
      quiet, honest fellow; I had known him from a child, and treated him as a
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, one day, in the house where I was living, I heard screams of abuse,
      cries, and lamentations; the woman of the house had had two hens stolen,
      and she laid the theft at my servant&rsquo;s door. He defended himself, called
      me to witness.... &ldquo;Likely he&rsquo;d turn thief, he, Yegor Avtamonov!&rdquo; I assured
      the woman of Yegor&rsquo;s honesty, but she would not listen to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All at once the thud of horses&rsquo; hoofs was heard along the street; the
      commander-in-chief was riding by with his staff. He was riding at a
      walking pace, a stout, corpulent man, with drooping head, and epaulettes
      hanging on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The woman saw him, and rushing before his horse, flung herself on her
      knees, and, bare-headed and all in disorder, she began loudly complaining
      of my servant, pointing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;General!&rdquo; she screamed; &ldquo;your Excellency! make an inquiry! help me! save
      me! this soldier has robbed me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yegor stood at the door of the house, bolt upright, his cap in his hand,
      he even arched his chest and brought his heels together like a sentry, and
      not a word! Whether he was abashed at all the general&rsquo;s suite halting
      there in the middle of the street, or stupefied by the calamity facing
      him, I can&rsquo;t say, but there stood my poor Yegor, blinking and white as
      chalk!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The commander-in-chief cast an abstracted and sullen glance at him,
      growled angrily, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; ... Yegor stood like a statue, showing his teeth
      as if he were grinning! Looking at him from the side, you&rsquo;d say the fellow
      was laughing!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then the commander-in-chief jerked out: &ldquo;Hang him!&rdquo; spurred his horse,
      and moved on, first at a walking-pace, then at a quick trot. The whole
      staff hurried after him; only one adjutant turned round on his saddle and
      took a passing glance at Yegor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To disobey was impossible.... Yegor was seized at once and led off to
      execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he broke down altogether, and simply gasped out twice, &ldquo;Gracious
      heavens! gracious heavens!&rdquo; and then in a whisper, &ldquo;God knows, it wasn&rsquo;t
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bitterly, bitterly he cried, saying good-bye to me. I was in despair.
      &ldquo;Yegor! Yegor!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;how came it you said nothing to the general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;God knows, it wasn&rsquo;t me!&rdquo; the poor fellow repeated, sobbing. The woman
      herself was horrified. She had never expected such a dreadful termination,
      and she started howling on her own account! She fell to imploring all and
      each for mercy, swore the hens had been found, that she was ready to clear
      it all up....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, all that was no sort of use. Those were war-times, sir!
      Discipline! The woman sobbed louder and louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yegor, who had received absolution from the priest, turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Tell her, your honour, not to upset herself.... I&rsquo;ve forgiven her.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My acquaintance, as he repeated this, his servant&rsquo;s last words, murmured,
      &lsquo;My poor Yegor, dear fellow, a real saint!&rsquo; and the tears trickled down
      his old cheeks.

      WHAT SHALL I THINK?...
    </h2>
    <p>
      What shall I think when I come to die, if only I am in a condition to
      think anything then?
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I think how little use I have made of my life, how I have slumbered,
      dozed through it, how little I have known how to enjoy its gifts?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? is this death? So soon? Impossible! Why, I have had no time to do
      anything yet.... I have only been making ready to begin!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I recall the past, and dwell in thought on the few bright moments I
      have lived through&mdash;on precious images and faces?
    </p>
    <p>
      Will my ill deeds come back to my mind, and will my soul be stung by the
      burning pain of remorse too late?
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I think of what awaits me beyond the grave ... and in truth does
      anything await me there?
    </p>
    <p>
      No.... I fancy I shall try not to think, and shall force myself to take
      interest in some trifle simply to distract my own attention from the
      menacing darkness, which is black before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I once saw a dying man who kept complaining they would not let him have
      hazel-nuts to munch!... and only in the depths of his fast-dimming eyes,
      something quivered and struggled like the torn wing of a bird wounded to
      death....

    <h2>
      &lsquo;HOW FAIR, HOW FRESH WERE THE ROSES ...&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      Somewhere, sometime, long, long ago, I read a poem. It was soon forgotten
      ... but the first line has stuck in my memory&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;<i>How fair, how fresh were the roses ...</i>&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      Now is winter; the frost has iced over the window-panes; in the dark room
      burns a solitary candle. I sit huddled up in a corner; and in my head the
      line keeps echoing and echoing&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;<i>How fair, how fresh were the roses ...</i>&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      And I see myself before the low window of a Russian country house. The
      summer evening is slowly melting into night, the warm air is fragrant of
      mignonette and lime-blossom; and at the window, leaning on her arm, her
      head bent on her shoulder, sits a young girl, and silently, intently gazes
      into the sky, as though looking for new stars to come out. What candour,
      what inspiration in the dreamy eyes, what moving innocence in the parted
      questioning lips, how calmly breathes that still-growing, still-untroubled
      bosom, how pure and tender the profile of the young face! I dare not speak
      to her; but how dear she is to me, how my heart beats!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;<i>How fair, how fresh were the roses ...</i>&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      But here in the room it gets darker and darker.... The candle burns dim
      and gutters, dancing shadows quiver on the low ceiling, the cruel crunch
      of the frost is heard outside, and within the dreary murmur of old age....
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;<i>How fair, how fresh were the roses ...</i>&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      There rise up before me other images. I hear the merry hubbub of home life
      in the country. Two flaxen heads, bending close together, look saucily at
      me with their bright eyes, rosy cheeks shake with suppressed laughter,
      hands are clasped in warm affection, young kind voices ring one above the
      other; while a little farther, at the end of the snug room, other hands,
      young too, fly with unskilled fingers over the keys of the old piano, and
      the Lanner waltz cannot drown the hissing of the patriarchal samovar ...
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;<i>How fair, how fresh were the roses ...</i>&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      The candle flickers and goes out.... Whose is that hoarse and hollow
      cough? Curled up, my old dog lies, shuddering at my feet, my only
      companion.... I&rsquo;m cold ... I&rsquo;m frozen ... and all of them are dead ...
      dead ...

    <h2>
      ON THE SEA
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was going from Hamburg to London in a small steamer. We were two
      passengers; I and a little female monkey, whom a Hamburg merchant was
      sending as a present to his English partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was fastened by a light chain to one of the seats on deck, and was
      moving restlessly and whining in a little plaintive pipe like a bird&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time I passed by her she stretched out her little, black, cold hand,
      and peeped up at me out of her little mournful, almost human eyes. I took
      her hand, and she ceased whining and moving restlessly about.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead calm. The sea stretched on all sides like a motionless
      sheet of leaden colour. It seemed narrowed and small; a thick fog overhung
      it, hiding the very mast-tops in cloud, and dazing and wearying the eyes
      with its soft obscurity. The sun hung, a dull red blur in this obscurity;
      but before evening it glowed with strange, mysterious, lurid light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long, straight folds, like the folds in some heavy silken stuff, passed
      one after another over the sea from the ship&rsquo;s prow, and broadening as
      they passed, and wrinkling and widening, were smoothed out again with a
      shake, and vanished. The foam flew up, churned by the tediously thudding
      wheels; white as milk, with a faint hiss it broke up into serpentine
      eddies, and then melted together again and vanished too, swallowed up by
      the mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persistent and plaintive as the monkey&rsquo;s whine rang the small bell at the
      stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time a porpoise swam up, and with a sudden roll disappeared
      below the scarcely ruffled surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the captain, a silent man with a gloomy, sunburnt face, smoked a short
      pipe and angrily spat into the dull, stagnant sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all my inquiries he responded by a disconnected grumble. I was obliged
      to turn to my sole companion, the monkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down beside her; she ceased whining, and again held out her hand to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clinging fog oppressed us both with its drowsy dampness; and buried in
      the same unconscious dreaminess, we sat side by side like brother and
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      I smile now ... but then I had another feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are all children of one mother, and I was glad that the poor little
      beast was soothed and nestled so confidingly up to me, as to a brother.

      THE MONK
    </h2>
    <p>
      I used to know a monk, a hermit, a saint. He lived only for the sweetness
      of prayer; and steeping himself in it, he would stand so long on the cold
      floor of the church that his legs below the knees grew numb and senseless
      as blocks of wood. He did not feel them; he stood on and prayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understood him, and perhaps envied him; but let him too understand me
      and not condemn me; me, for whom his joys are inaccessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has attained to annihilating himself, his hateful <i>ego</i>; but I
      too; it&rsquo;s not from egoism, I pray not.
    </p>
    <p>
      My <i>ego</i>, may be, is even more burdensome and more odious to me, than
      his to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has found wherein to forget himself ... but I, too, find the same,
      though not so continuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He does not lie ... but neither do I lie.

    <h2>
      WE WILL STILL FIGHT ON
    </h2>
    <p>
      What an insignificant trifle may sometimes transform the whole man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of melancholy thought, I walked one day along the highroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart was oppressed by a weight of gloomy apprehension; I was
      overwhelmed by dejection. I raised my head.... Before me, between two rows
      of tall poplars, the road darted like an arrow into the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And across it, across this road, ten paces from me, in the golden light of
      the dazzling summer sunshine, a whole family of sparrows hopped one after
      another, hopped saucily, drolly, self-reliantly!
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them, in particular, skipped along sideways with desperate energy,
      puffing out his little bosom and chirping impudently, as though to say he
      was not afraid of any one! A gallant little warrior, really!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, meanwhile, high overhead in the heavens hovered a hawk, destined,
      perhaps, to devour that little warrior.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked, laughed, shook myself, and the mournful thoughts flew right
      away: pluck, daring, zeal for life I felt anew. Let him, too, hover over
      me, <i>my</i> hawk.... We will fight on, and damn it all!

    <h2>
      PRAYER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whatever a man pray for, he prays for a miracle. Every prayer reduces to
      this: &lsquo;Great God, grant that twice two be not four.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Only such a prayer is a real prayer from person to person. To pray to the
      Cosmic Spirit, to the Higher Being, to the Kantian, Hegelian,
      quintessential, formless God is impossible and unthinkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But can even a personal, living, imaged God make twice two not be four?
    </p>
    <p>
      Every believer is bound to answer, <i>he can</i>, and is bound to persuade
      himself of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if reason sets him revolting against this senselessness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Shakespeare comes to his aid: &lsquo;There are more things in heaven and
      earth, Horatio,&rsquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if they set about confuting him in the name of truth, he has but to
      repeat the famous question, &lsquo;What is truth?&rsquo; And so, let us drink and be
      merry, and say our prayers.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
